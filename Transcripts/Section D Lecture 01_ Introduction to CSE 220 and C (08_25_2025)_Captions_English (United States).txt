[Auto-generated transcript. Edits may have been applied for clarity.]
Hopefully that's where you plan to be. It seems like a lot of people. But you also look like nerds, so probably were good.

I when I first walked in, I was like, is this like a the wrong class or something?

I didn't expect it to be so full. Um, but this is KSI 220 and we are going to talk about systems programing this semester.

This is one of those rare courses, although you have a number of them in KSI,

where the title of the course is actually what we're going to talk about.

Um. First things first before I go too far, because I have two of my student assistants here.

Do I have any others? Just two. Two in the front? Yeah, I have two of my student assistants here.

I'm going to introduce you to them. So if you could stand up. Uh, this is Sarah and Aiden.

Uh, they will be two of your. You have 25 student assistants on this course this semester.

They will be two of your student assistants.

I'm introducing you to them because they're some of the most important people that you're going to know this semester.

I don't know about these two specifically, um, for your labs, but student assistants will be teaching your labs.

You'll have two, uh, student assistants in your labs. They will also be serving the majority of the office hours in this course.

Um, Carl and I, there's two instructors on this course.

We'll also have office hours, but there's only two of us, and there's 400 of you.

Uh, so you're going to get to know your student assistants. They are not scary.

Two of them bite, but not during class. Uh, they are happy to help you.

They're all here for one of two reasons. Either because they really enjoyed this material and they want to share it with you,

or because they really did not enjoy this material and they want to minimize your suffering.

So please take advantage of them. Come see them.

Look how friendly they are.

Um, they will be happy to see you throughout the semester, and you guys are welcome to stick around or bounce or whatever it is you have to do.

You've already been with me for an hour or so. Yeah. See you. Sarah. Um.

So there's 25 student assistants and there are two faculty members on this course.

We run this course. There are four sections ABCd. This is D right where d yeah.

Um, we run this course as one large course in four sections and for 20 laps or whatever it is.

Which means that while I will be your lecturer and structure instructor every lecture, and while you have a particular lab assistant,

who is your lab assistant, you should not feel like you have to come to me or you have to go to that lab assistant.

If you have a question, you look at the schedule and Carl has office hours.

Go to Carl's office hours. Right. He will be happy to help you, uh, with this course.

If you have a particular, um, student assistant that you've worked with in office hours,

and they are not your lab assistant, but you just really think they're super helpful.

Great. Go see them every time, right. It is one course with just a pool of instructors.

That said, for better or for worse, you will be seeing me three times a week for the rest of the semester in this lecture.

Um, barring travel or sickness or something.

In which case Carl might spot me. Uh, you would ordinarily see.

Um. Who am I? My name is Ethan Blanton.

Uh, I am you can find me in Davis 334.

There is my well, I hate. I can't point to anything in this room.

There is my email address right there. Uh, you can email me.

You can come see me in my office. My open office hours are from 9 to 9:50 a.m. on Wednesdays.

But if that time doesn't work for you or there's something we need to talk about or whatever, send me an email.

Right. We'll schedule a time to talk. Um, my office is on the third floor of Davis, behind the bathrooms.

So if you go past the bathrooms into that long hallway on the west side of the building, turn left.

Down the long end of the hallway. It's almost all the way down on the right.

You'll be like, this is surely not where I'm supposed to be going. I promise that if I'm there, you'll know.

You'll hear me. But if I'm not there, or if I'm had not been to not be meeting with someone,

I'm almost all the way down, uh, on the right hand side at the end of the hallway.

Um, who am I? Uh, I am here, so I worked for a little while in.

I got a PhD because I wanted to teach. I really wanted to teach.

So I got a PhD, and it didn't work out for me for various life reasons where I was living and whatever.

And so I didn't teach for a while. I worked in industry. I worked on compilers and runtime systems.

I did some networking work. I did some of the things, did my PhD in networking. Um, and then I came to UB and I got the opportunity to teach.

And so I said, I would like to teach. I am teaching systems programing because I love systems.

Not just computer systems. Not just programing systems, not just operating systems.

I love systems. So when I say systems, I mean all of the things that sort of make our world work the way it works.

So I mean, plumbing is interesting. I mean, it's wet, but plumbing is interesting if you look at it the right way.

Right? Electricity, uh, mechanical systems, engines, whatever.

Like, I love all of it. Anything that has little fiddly bits that you can take apart and see how they work and put them back together.

I'm on board. I love it. Uh, I'm teaching systems programing because when I got here, I said I'd like to teach a course.

They said, how about 191? I said, how about not? Uh, and then they said, well, there's some other options here.

What can we talk about? Our systems program? I said, what's that? Because that sounds like something I'd like to do.

I've been teaching it for 7 or 8 years or something since then because I really enjoy it.

I think it's a good course. I think there's a lot of good material, uh, in this course, and I think it's very important.

It's one of them.

I mean, everybody thinks their courses like one of the more important courses you're going to take, but it's pretty foundational, right?

There's a lot of things that sit on top of the things that you learn in a course like this.

Are there any questions? This time it was fixing the glasses.

Every time you say, are there any questions? Somebodys hand goes like this and then does it doesn't make it.

All right. So this course is actually, as I said, surprisingly concerned with systems programing.

Uh, what we're going to learn about is computer systems.

We're going to learn about how computers are put together, how they do the computations that they do, and why they behave the way they behave.

The reason for that is that we have to meet computers in the middle.

When we write programs, we have to ask the computer to do something that the computer can reasonably do.

The way the computer is designed, its architecture, its instruction set, its memory layout,

the so all the things that make it a particular kind of computer that it is.

Dictate the way we write our programs and the way we solve our problems.

And our goal in this course is to help you understand how those computers work,

why they do the things the way they do them, and what it is that they do.

So that when you encounter a computing problem that you've not seen before, you can say, hmm, I think I have a way to approach this or, oh,

I don't know how this works, but I bet if I look over there that's going to give me something I can grab on to,

right and start to understand this problem, right. So our big goal in this course is to teach you enough about computer systems and

architecture to improve your intuitions about how the programs that we write,

read and run do the things that they do. We're also going to ask you to practice solving real problems by writing programs.

Now you're a sophomore. This is, for most of you, your third programing course.

They're not big problems, but they are, in fact, real problems.

Every single assignment you do in this course.

Echoes something that I have had to do at some point in my career to solve a real problem that I had to solve.

Now, it wasn't the whole problem in most cases, because like in most of these cases, there's already something that will do that, right?

Um, but it was a portion of a problem that I had to solve.

Right? There are real problems with real solutions that will help you understand how to structure your programs in the future, etc.

We're also going to teach you a little bit about how to use Linux, specifically in more generically Unix like systems at the command line.

Um, there is a post on Piazza right now at nine, which has a whole bunch of help for how to use command line resources.

I recommend that in this first slow week or so, as we get rolling and you start to, you know, get logged into your systems and whatever that,

you take some time and you look at some of those resources because it will pay dividends as the course goes on.

If you get halfway through the semester and you realize that you've never really spent any time learning anything about the command line,

you're in a deeper hole than if you start sort of towing yourself in here at the beginning of the.

Now we understand that you've never used the command line before, and you don't know anything about how these systems work necessarily.

And we will help you. But we do not spend a lot of time teaching you the details because there's lots of documentation out there.

We link a number of documents.

In particular, there's one from the Free Software Foundation, uh, about using the menu system or something like that, and it's the link for it.

And at nine says, like, just to read a couple chapters, it's the one that says, just read these chapters or sections or whatever.

The reason is, it's very long document. Don't try to read the whole thing. There's a bunch of crap in there that nobody cares about.

Uh, but those sections are a really good place to sort of get started to teach you a little bit about like, basically how the system is going.

And then we are going to teach you the sea.

Well, we're going to allow you to teach yourself the C programing language and a little bit about what we call the Posix API.

And we'll talk about politics and APIs more probably on Wednesday.

But essentially that is a particular programing model for systems that look like Unix systems.

And then C is a programing language that is used to implement systems things.

So we're going to use those things as a tool to help us understand the rest of the things.

Any questions? I will try this semester.

Or this. Uh, not this semester. That sounds like a commitment.

This class period, to stop frequently and ask you if you have any questions.

But I will stop doing that as the semester goes on. Uh, as you become more comfortable, you at any time put your hand up.

If you have a question, and I will take the time to answer your question. Right.

So if even if I don't ask, if you're just like, what is he talking about? Just stick your hand up and.

So the point of all this is that programing doesn't occur in a vacuum.

We use particular programing languages.

All right. Some of you may feel my pain.

Uh, I suffer from a condition that we call ADHD, where I am easily distracted and I just walk past this light switch over here.

And I want you to understand that there's a whole bunch of completely unmarked buttons on this light switch right here.

And there's a legend for what these buttons do.

And they taped it to the bottom of the light switch dangling here when there's a whole whiteboard here to tape it to.

Why are people like this? For people like me with ADHD.

Like I look at that and like, now that's all I can think about is why is it like that?

I. Well, yes. That's true. I understand why there has to be a label, but why is it not just taped to the wall and not dangling like this?

This is. You see, this is ridiculous. Anyway, this is going to hit me a lot through the semester.

You'll get used to it. Some of you will leave mean comments on my reviews about it.

It's. It's okay. All right. So programing does not occur in a vacuum in the sense that every programing language we use,

every program we use, every tool we use was written by someone to solve some problem, to run on some computer.

And I could invent a programing language and dream it up in my mind and code with the perfect model

for expressing a program and implement that programing language and design that programing language.

But when I went to implement it, I would have to deal with the fact that the computer works in a particular way,

and I would have to map that beautiful idea that I had to, the way the computer actually does computation,

and either me or the programing language, or the programmer would suffer for the fact that if I design that programing language in a vacuum,

I didn't consider how it is that the computer is actually going to come up with the answer that I want.

So the way we actually design programing languages, rather than sitting down with a piece of paper and saying,

what if there were no computers and I had the perfect language? We say this is how computers work.

How do I write a language? How do I design a language to solve the kinds of problems that computers solve?

And so all of these programing languages that you will ever use have certain commonalities.

They behave in certain ways, like even if the language doesn't have a particular structure, right.

It's written in a different way. It will perform in certain ways, like there are certain things that you will ask a programing language to do.

And as a programmer has a good intuition for how the computer does computation, you'll say that's going to be slow.

Because that's just how the computer works.

But at this stage in your career, you don't necessarily have the intuition for how it is that the computer solves these things.

Right. And our goal is to show you, hey, these things work the way they work because that's how computation happens.

The computer is made up of silicon gates that make certain decisions in certain ways that represent data,

and certain ways that store data via certain methods, etc.

Now, we're not going to be at the really, really low level.

You'll get you'll have other courses, like most of you will take 341 um, probably next semester or maybe in fall of next year.

Computer organization, you'll talk about things that are even lower level than what we're going to talk about in this course,

but we're going to start giving the idea that, hey, this isn't a magic box that just runs these programs.

It's actually a machine that follows certain rules and does computation a certain way.

And when I write my programs, if I write my programs, understanding how this program,

this machine is going to do this computation, I can write better programs.

They run faster. They're easier to debug. Uh, and this also influence influences all the other things that we do.

For example, many of you, how many of you are in 250 right now? Okay.

Yeah, a bunch of you buy a planner. We'll talk about that here in a minute.

Um. In 250, you're going to spend a lot of time talking about how long it takes the computer to compare two numbers to each other, to determine.

Whether one is larger than the other. And you're like, this is the stupidest thing in the world.

Like I how often do I actually want to compare numbers? The thing is, you don't.

But it turns out that's one of the only things the computer actually knows how to do.

So when you write programs, the computer actually spends a lot of time comparing two numbers to one another.

Right. And so as programmers, we wind up thinking about these things a lot.

Not directly. You don't. Right. And you're not like, oh, I'm going to write this 3D game engine rendering, you know, Polygon Engine.

And I really want to think about comparing two numbers to one another.

But you will get to places that say, oh, that's going to require a lot of sorting.

Sorting is slow. I can't do that right. Or whatever as you build your intuition for how computer.

So our goal is to build that intuition and help you understand that context. This course, and I don't know if I should talk about this or not, I.

Every semester I debate on taking the slide out of here because when I don't have it here, people are scared.

And when I do have it here, if they're not scared, they are by the time I'm done talking.

Uh, but I want to stress to you that this is not a weed out course.

This course is not intended. To make your life difficult.

This course is intended to teach you something important. And I have a logical proof for you that this is not a weed out course.

So we know, of course, as of course that causes you to drop the major, leave the university, etc.

What does UB want from you more than anything else in the world?

Your tuition. If I fail you and you leave.

You give them tuition? No. I don't.

They don't. You don't? I don't. By the way, I haven't paid the same.

Whether there's one of you in this room or 200 of you in this room. Right?

We're not paid the same as the kids. Maybe. Actually, don't let professors complain to you about how little money they make.

We're fine. Like we're all eating. It's okay. Um.

I have no incentive to fail you. The department has no incentive to fail you.

The university has an. Actually, the department has an incentive.

They do get money for. How many of you are in this room? Think about whether that's fair or not.

Is the department standing here? If you're doing this course? They are not I am they get more money.

If there's more of you, I get paid the same. Anyway.

Um, the dean of this university makes approximately seven times of this.

Part of this, of course, makes approximately seven times what I make.

Think about that every morning when I come to work, every morning when I come to work, I'm saying. Than one seventh of what the DNS.

That's just okay with me. Anyway. Point is, there's no point in failing you.

I want you to learn. I want you to succeed. The department wants you to learn.

The department wants you to succeed. The university wants you to keep paying that sweet, sweet moolah.

So this is not a weed out course. It is, however, difficult.

The thing is, there's reasons that it's difficult. It's not difficult just to be difficult.

And if you approach it saying this is just hard and there's nothing we can do about that, then it's going to be hard.

But if you look at it and you say, why is it hard and how can I address that?

You can make it easier. It is difficult because the topic that we are learning is persnickety.

We are asking the computer at the lowest level that you've ever dealt with a computer for many of you to do things,

and the computer is the completely unforgiving oracle of the ancients that does exactly what you asked it to do and not what you wanted.

And so if you don't ask it to do exactly what you actually want, it's going to do something else.

The languages you have learned and been asked to use so far.

Try to put guardrails around some of the parts that are particularly annoying.

And say to you, you can't have that number, it would be out of range.

This semester. Your computer, your program. When you ask for a number that is out of range,

your program catches on fire and burned to the ground and leaves no evidence behind as to what the problem was.

Right, because we've moved closer to the computer itself,

and the computer itself is cold and uncaring and does exactly what you asked for, even if it's stupid.

And this is your third programing course. You're going to ask it to do things that don't make sense.

You're going to think you asked it one thing and you actually asked it something else.

But if you recognize that that's just the world we're working in,

and that if you can gather the information to get enough details to understand what you actually ask for, you can find the problem and you can fix it.

Um, another reason is this is a 200 level course. So 100 level courses.

You open the handout and it says first click at the bottom left corner of your screen screen to open the menu.

And then run this program and run this menu item and type exactly these things.

And then push the little play button and watch it run. 200 level courses.

Say, I assume you know how to do all those things. Write me a program that satisfies this very strict set of requirements.

300 level courses. Say, here's a couple of requirements.

Write a program that meets those. Figure the details out on your own.

For higher level courses. They say design a project. I'll see you in 14 weeks.

Right. It's a staging from one to the other to the other, and the gap between 100 and 200 is large.

We give you a lot less direction, and at the same time, we give you an environment that is a lot pickier.

So it's difficult.

But if you recognize that all of those individual steps that you have to do in your 100 level course still exist at the 200 level course,

you just need to fill in the details and you take the time to fill in the details before you start just blindly bashing at your.

Editor. It's going to be fine, right? It's going to be fine.

Um, also time management, all of you who raise your hand said you're also in 250.

How many of you who are in 220 and 250 already have a planner, like a paper planner, to organize your life?

Okay, you're going to be fine. The rest of you, go get one.

Because the biggest thing you need this semester is time management.

If you assume that there will be enough time to get everything done.

Then four hours before the deadline, you're going to realize that you need about 30.

And it's going to be a problem. But if you start things early, you work a little bit of time.

You schedule some time for 220, you schedule some time for 250,

and you make sure that you sort of know where your comings and goings are at all times.

You're going to be fine, right? It's going to be all right. But time management is going to be important to you this semester.

I promise to you that you will get out of this course what you put into it.

If you come to this course ready to learn. If you ask questions when you have them.

If you try to understand what it is you're accomplishing.

You will leave this course knowing so many things that you did not know.

Walking in. I promise. If you just try to get a grade out of it, you're probably going to suffer and you're not going to earn as much.

And ironically, your grade will be poorer, right? The material is what's important.

Learning how the systems work is what's important. Any questions?

All right. So, um, I'm going to gloss over this next couple of slides.

Essentially, uh, I expect you to be an adult, behave like an adult, and be here to learn.

And I expect you to treat my student assistants and each other.

And to a lesser extent, me and Carl, because we're big boys and we can take care of ourselves with respect.

Uh, and if that if you do all of those things, then it's going to be fine.

Everything's going to be fine.

In particular, remember that your student assistants are students just like you, and they're here because they want to help you.

They are not here for the money. Every last one of them could make more money at Mighty Taco.

They're here because they want to help. They're just students.

They have their own schedules, they have their own lives, etc. please treat them that way.

Right. They will be here to help you. Don't make demands, though.

Don't be. Don't pressure them. Don't you know? Be respectful.

In return, you can and should expect that we will respect you.

We will respect your time. We will respect your learning, and we will do our best to help you get through this material.

Um. If at any point in time you have trouble in this course with any student, assistant or you know any aspect of the course.

Come see me. Or come see Carl and say, hey, you know, I've been having trouble in office hours, don't really get along with somebody, you know,

or I just am having trouble communicating or I'm not understanding the answers I'm getting or, you know, whatever problem you're having.

If you have a problem with me or Carl, go to the director of undergraduate studies.

The department chair. And say, hey, I have trouble with an instructor in my course.

He's a jerk, you know? He whatever. Dave's heard it all before.

He knows. Um, because you are paying good money to be here.

And most of you are trying to learn and trying to get ahead.

And we should be providing an environment where you can.

So if you're doing your part and we're not doing our part, let us know and we'll try to do something about that.

If you're not doing your part and it's really only bothering you,

you do you if you're not doing your part and it's a problem for my student assistants,

or it's a problem for the other people in the class,

then you're getting an email from me and I'm going to say, come meet me and you're probably going to cry.

Just historically speaking, that's usually what comes out. It doesn't happen often, but it does happen occasionally.

Any questions? About expectations or why we're here, or what we're learning.

I promise I am not a nice guy, but I also am here to help you learn and it's going to be fine.

So don't be scared. Also like come see me if you need to see me. I promise I don't bite.

I'm nice. Usually. I'm adequately nice.

All right. Lecture attendance is mandatory. You must be here three days a week from now until the end of the semester.

I will take attendance. If you read the syllabus which I require you to do.

You will find that you're actually allowed to miss a significant number of lectures, and it's going to be fine.

Um, but you are required to attend, and I will take attendance.

If I take attendance, and we do that by doing lecture activities that you get points for.

If I take attendance and you do the lecture activity and you are not sitting in this room and I find out about it,

that is a violation of academic integrity. And you fail this course with an F.

Every semester. Somebody chooses to skip too many lectures.

Panics, decides they really need to do the lecture activity even though they're not here.

You catch them. And it would have been better to just not do it.

So please. If you're not in lecture, don't do the lecture activity.

If you miss lecture, we expect you to catch up on your own.

If you have to miss a large number of lectures for structural reasons, for example, an illness,

or you have to leave the country in an emergency and you're gone for three weeks, or, you know, something happens.

Contact us. Right, we'll work with you. But if you just have trouble getting up at 2 p.m.

You're laughing, but, like, this is my first semester. I don't want to hear it right.

Come lecture. Uh, labs are also mandatory, and we do track attendance.

Um, we do expect you to do your labs in lab.

Many particularly of the sort of middle the. So this lab in the middle of the semester labs they don't take nearly two hours to complete.

Right. And people say, well, I don't want to go. I want to do them at home, and I don't want to go to lab, and I don't want to spend that two hours.

I mean, at the end of the day. Tough, right? I told you, you have to go.

But the point is, the reason we ask you to go is that on other labs, you'll find that if you approach them incorrectly,

if you're not doing what we intend for you to be doing, they can take a lot more than two hours to complete.

And I really would rather you use that time on your readings and your programing assignments and things like that.

Right. So if you prepare for your labs ahead of time, you come to your lab,

you work on your lab in lab, hopefully it bounds the amount of time you spend on lab you have.

You get all the points right. And you can ask the questions that you have every lab in this course.

It cracks me up every semester. Somebody says. The things we talked about in class we didn't see on any program or assignment.

Which is just false. I don't know what class they're going to, and I didn't understand what the labs had to do with the programing assignments.

Almost every lab in this course,

there's a portion of it that if you copy it and paste it and maybe change a couple of little characters into your program assignment,

you'll get like points, right? The point is that they're preparing you for your programing assignments.

So ask the questions, be in lab, understand them.

Don't just get them done, understand them. And then your programing assignments will go more smoothly.

Don't be one of those people who doesn't see the connection. If you don't.

If you don't understand why I would ask you to do it. Ask yourself what you're missing.

Don't assume I don't know what I'm doing. Um, anything else I want to say about this?

Kind of class, right? You're paying for this. It's like $100. Every time you come to class, you're paying, like, $100 to listen to me talk.

So if nothing else, make sure you're getting your money's worth.

Uh, if you're in state and you have, like, Excelsior or whatever, like, it goes down pretty rapidly,

but still you're paying a chunk of money, or the New York taxpayers or somebody is paying a chunk of money.

So. Use it wisely. Oh, so there's a whole list of things here that people do and then regret.

Don't do them. In particular, start your assignments early.

Work a little bit every day. Don't try to do them all in one huge rush.

Ask questions as soon as you are having confusion.

Don't wait until you're completely stuck because the time in between is wasted, right?

As soon as you start to be confused, come ask questions and don't cheat.

If you cheat, I will fill you with an F.

I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about that because it causes what it mostly causes is the people who are going to do the right thing,

to worry the whole time that they might be doing the wrong thing, and the people who are going to do the wrong thing don't care.

Um, but in general, just, you know, don't.

Every single lecture I give you.

Well, maybe not every single lecture, but like 80% of the lectures that I give you will have required readings and may have optional readings.

Uh, there will be a tab up here at the top of lectures.

These are clickable. If you click it, it will take you to the required readings.

Uh, I will not necessarily call out the required readings.

I will just assume that you all go look and see what the required readings are for each, uh, lecture.

Um. You don't have to do them before lecture, but you should do them shortly after we start the lecture module.

So, for example, this lecture I want you to read the syllabus in chapter one of K and R.

You should plan to do that by say Wednesday or maybe Thursday of this week.

That would be great time frame right. Not necessarily the day we open it.

And now if you have time, if you're late this afternoon, you're just like, well, I'm all moved in and I don't.

Not sure what I should do. Go read cancer, right? I mean, today is great, but it doesn't necessarily have to be today, but it should be soon.

In particular, I will tell you that there are several labs and programing assignments that are discussed essentially

in exact detail in one of the readings I will give you at various times throughout the semester.

Every single semester, the midterm comes and somebody who hasn't done any of their readings decides to do their readings.

And they come to me and they're like, I wish I had known that, like, PA, whatever is in chapter or whatever.

It's like, well, I assigned it to you for a reason, so I wish you had known that too.

Um, but please do your readings in a timely fashion. You will be a happier camper.

You should definitely read the syllabus. I'm sure there's good stuff in it. Uh, again, I won't necessarily talk about, uh, the require readings.

I will just assume that you are doing them.

So there are also going to be optional readings on many of the slides. The optional readings are different.

You do not have to do those. The optional readings are there either because I think some of you might find them interesting,

or I think they might provide you with some information that you might not otherwise encounter that is relevant to the topic or in a few cases,

because I really wanted them to be required. But I didn't want to make you buy another book.

Uh, in particular, there's a number of readings out of computer systems, of programmers perspective,

um, that are not required only because it's $180 textbook, and I don't want you to have to pay for it.

So you may it's various points.

Want to like, say, go to the library and, you know, sit down with a copy of that and look through some of the readings, right.

Particularly if you're feeling a little behind and there are readings on a topic that you would like more information about.

Yes. These slides are available on the course web page.

The course web page is linked on. You've learned from the overview its CSS courses 20 I think.

And these links are clickable, by the way, and everything in the slides. Good question.

I should have mentioned that earlier. I think it was actually on one of the slides, but.

That isn't any good because you can't click it. Um. Any questions about readings?

All right. So your primary form for assistance in this course will be Piazza.

If you are a returning UB student, you already know Piazza. If you are a transferring student, Piazza is essentially a support forum.

Um, you will be able to ask questions of me, Carl and the course staff easily on Piazza.

You will also see each others questions if you ask public questions, although you can anonymize your own,

um, username so people can't see who's asking the question or who's answering it.

Um, please read the Piazza.

Um, in particular, if you have questions, just go ahead and glance through and see if your question might already be there.

If you're feeling stuck on an assignment and go look and see the kinds of things that people are asking,

see if there's anything there that would help get you unstuck.

If at any point you have a question you believe it is not answered on Piazza, please ask.

If you're looking at Piazza and you say, oh, question number 47, I think is what I'm asking, but I don't understand it.

Just ask a new question, right, and say, I don't. I have this question.

I don't think I see the answer. We might say we think number 47 answers your question, you know.

Does it. And then you just say, well, I thought it might too, but I don't I don't understand it.

And here's why. Right. And help us sort of zoom in on the answer. Right. If you ever are not sure just ask again.

If you want to ask a follow up to someone else's question, ask a follow up to someone else's question, right?

But please use PR and use it fruitfully.

Uh, we will definitely post important stuff that you need to know on Piazza, so you should check it regularly.

Um, frequently with when we release assignments and labs and things like that, we will.

It doesn't do anything. I can turn it on and then. Yeah, but then we'll be on the recording if I turn it on.

Um, yeah. It's like a two way permission thing. I have to give you permission.

Then you have to ask to actually talk. Um.

You know what's really cool? Have you guys seen this? Look at the back of the room back there. That cool.

I like to do it when there's people studying up there, and then they're like, what is happening right now?

It's great when you see shadows up there and like people trying to look in it, you just open it.

Uh. Did I mention that I probably have ADHD?

Um, okay. So, uh, that's the other. So uh, that's basically it for logistics etc.

We're going to start talking our program times. Then what? At some point we'll start talking about material.

Are there any questions about logistics so far? Pretty straightforward right.

All right. Um. A significant portion of your grade is the programing assignments that we will ask you to do,

I think is like 35% of your grade or something that's in the service. Um, their individual assignments.

We will ask you to write them in the C programing language.

Uh, we expect them to run on a particular computer that computers Imaan dot csv buffalo.edu.

Iman is just a server in a server room in Davis. There's a photo of it actually in lab one.

Um, because we thought it might help you to see your friend.

What? What it looks like. Um.

It's just a time shared Unix machine that we will all use. I think there's another slide about that here in a minute.

The reason I tell you this is because if you write a program and it compiles and runs correctly on demand.

And it goes down in flames on auto greater. And you come to me and you say, I think there's a problem, I will look.

If you write a program and it compiles and runs correctly on your laptop and it goes down in flames on auto grader, I will say I don't care.

Because I can't support every machine in the whole world, but I can support him.

All right. So we provided to you to provide a uniform known programing environment.

It's running exactly the same software stack that the graders will be running for you to develop and debug your code on.

Um, you will also program in the C programing language, which you do not know.

Learning the C programing language. Teaching it to yourself is a course objective.

One of the required readings that we give you is in Ritchie the C programing environment, as you may have a copy of K and R with them.

Of course you do. Why would you lie to me?

Um. I'll mark this down for later.

So the point of that I want to show you is a tiny little book. Right.

It's like this thick. Everything you need to know about C is in that book.

This book is so good. It is objectively an excellent book.

It is so good that the other kind, of course, that it is assigned in other than computer science courses.

Technical writing courses. As an example of what your technical writing should look like.

That doesn't mean it's necessarily easy to read all the time.

But it has a lot of really good information in an approachable way, in a small amount of space.

Read it. When you don't understand.

Which there will be things you don't understand. Ask us questions.

We're here to help you through it. We're not here to teach you everything that's in that book.

Because we gave you the book.

We're here to help you understand what you read in the book, because learning the C programing language will be a valuable thing for you.

Not just knowing C, which may or may not be valuable for you,

but teaching yourself a programing language because you are going to learn over the course of your career,

many programing languages, and for most of them you will not have a Paul or a Jess here and Eric or whoever

standing at the front of the room telling you how the language is going to work.

You're going to have some pile of internal documentation for a language that's only used inside your company.

That was written in 1977 by somebody who not only retired, but it's also dead.

Right and go learn it right. And as you learn to read these documents, starting with a really excellent one.

You'll build the skill of sort of teaching yourself these things and growing your own horizons, right?

But if you have questions, ask us. That's what we're here for.

We will teach you a little bit about some of the more surprising things about see, but we're not going to spend a lot of time on it.

We'll just expect you to pick it up along the way. Um, I already said all these things.

Uh, you will access him on via a protocol called SSH. There are instructions in at eight on Piazza for how to do that.

Um, ssh is a command line remote access protocol.

So you will be dropped into a command line where you will type Unix commands.

Learning something about how the command line works is a learning objective for this course.

Again we're not going to spend a lot of time teaching it to you, but we will at many points in this course.

For example, lab one has a bunch of this say, here's some things you need to do.

Here's how you do them. The next time we need you to do them, we'll just say, go do it.

We're not going to tell you how to do it. You can go back and look at lab one, right.

If you have questions. That'll happen many times throughout this course. We'll teach you the debugger.

We'll teach you a build system, will teach you some other things, and then expect you to refer back to that throughout the course.

Uh, I think I already said this, but your teaching assistants will be your primary source of help for your programing projects, labs, etc.

It's for the simple reason that there's so many of you and so few of me and Carl.

Um, they're just more they have more time to spend with you one on one.

But if at any time you need help from me or from Carl, from a faculty member comes to us, right?

Either comes. He has an open office hours. I will have office hours this Wednesday morning.

Uh, I think Carl also has office hours this Wednesday morning, starting on Wednesday.

Um, come see us. Or if you can't make those office hours or you have another question, send an email and we'll do our best.

When you do come see your teaching assistants. This should say student assistants, not teaching assistants for.

Reasons. Um, when you do come see your student assistants for, uh, help, please do your due diligence.

If you show up and say. I said it doesn't work.

They're going to say, wow. I'm sorry to hear that. Next. Right.

If you show up and say, I tried this, I got this result.

I don't understand why I didn't get this other result. They'll say, oh, let me help you figure out why that is right.

You need to give them something to work with. Again, there's 400 of you.

We can't, like, sit down and debug everybody's project, right?

There's 400 of you. But if you give them something to work with, they will work with you.

They will give you better answers.

We will, throughout the semester, talk about how to ask good questions, how to parse the answers, and how to get the information you need out of it.

Now this is the ugliest thing I'm going to talk about so far. I may have talked about some ugly things before, but I didn't mean to.

The ugly thing I'm going to talk about so far. We had a significant budget trim this semester.

Coming into this semester, I was given approximately two thirds.

Of the support budget to provide student assistance for you that I would normally get in a fall semester.

We have to run a certain number of laps. We have to have Tas in those labs, etc., where there's not negotiable.

There's a number of other things we have to do. We have to grade the final. We have to grade the midterm.

What in my budget is flexible. The number of office hours I can provide.

So we had to trim office hours. I don't like it, but I also can't do anything about.

Ordinarily, my Tas sit around bored for about the first week of the project.

Well, the same four people show up on the first day, ask their questions, right, and then rocket.

Then nobody shows up for the first week or so, and then at the last minute there's lines all the way down the hallway.

Because everybody just finally got around to starting their project. I am telling you that this semester that line will wrap around the building.

Because I don't have as many Tas holding as many office hours.

Please. Start early. Figure out where you're having struggles and ask your questions in those first few days.

You don't have to ask all your questions in the first few days,

but anything you can knock out of the way in the first few days is one fewer person standing in that line on the due date,

and you don't have to stand in line for that question on the due date, right?

So please plan ahead. I'm telling you right now, this semester is going to be ugly in office hours.

Be nice to your student assistants. They didn't make the budget.

I didn't make the budget. I don't know who made the budget.

Let's blame Kathy. If you don't live in New York.

That's our governor. Um, okay.

I don't care. You're going to be asked to edit source code in this course.

I don't care what editor you use as long as it is a real programmer's editor.

It better not be friggin Nano or Notepad Plus plus or whatever, right?

It needs to be a programmer's editor. I am going to ask you to try Emacs.

Emacs is a particular editor that is used by a lot of people for systems programing, and is installed on demand.

It is the only editor that we will support you using.

If you're using anything else, that's fine. You're on your own. You absolutely may not.

Under any circumstances. I will find you.

Run Visual Studio Code on Imam.

And you may not use Visual Studio Remote Access on iMap.

And that's not because Visual Studio is a bad editor. It is.

But that's not why I make that rule. It's because there's 400 of you.

In every instance of Visual Studio that you start uses two gigabytes of Ram.

And if you multiply two gigabytes by 400.

The metric unit for what you receive is a [INAUDIBLE] ton. And we don't have that much.

And so the computer crawls to a halt and we have to reboot it. And everybody's sad.

And it's the day of the deadline and, you know, whatever. And I don't want to deal with it.

So you may not run Visual Studio Code on Iman. You won't run on your own computer.

That's between you and your God. But you don't run it on my computer because that's between you and me.

Uh, I recommend you at least try to use Emacs if you don't like it, fine.

Not everybody likes everything. Uh, we have other editors installed on, uh, Imaan.

Um, um, vim and neo vim. I don't know what else there's a number of things installed on.

Is that it? I mean, that pretty much covers any error that anybody has any business using.

Okay. Cocoon and helix or I can. We can discuss that. All right.

Uh, so please use a real editor.

Um, and we will, if you want to use one that we're going to help you with, you will use Emacs.

Here's what I need you to do right now. We have passed out.

Programing. Assignment zero. Lab one.

Several videos and a quiz.

Maybe two quizzes. I think two quizzes. I think there's a quiz for programing Assignment zero and a quiz for the academic integrity policies.

Go do those things by your lab this week.

Make sure that you can log into Riemann. Did you have a GitHub account?

You can log into it and you know how to clone repositories from it.

Right. Uh, and that you've watched the lab video and looked over the lab handout.

That's all I ask you to do before lab. Read the syllabus at your earliest opportunity.

Ask any questions that you have. If you have any conflicts. If you have to.

You know if you need to work through like, um, accessibility resources or anything like that, right?

That all that information is in there and make sure you deal with those things, uh, and make sure you get started on your programing assignment.

Zero. Now, I will tell you now there is like two minutes left.

Why is everybody stand up? I will tell you right now.

Auto lab is down. I know that the machine that it is running on is currently doesn't exist or something I don't know.

I don't know. I know, and we'll deal with that if it comes to it.

My every hope is that it will be up by the time you would have lived this week,

but you will not be able to make sure you can connect to all the lab and stuff necessarily.

If you can't get to the lab, it ain't you. It's us, right? We'll let you know when Auto Lab is back up.

Um. All right, now you can get ready and go. I look forward to seeing you all here on Wednesday.

Ready to go?
