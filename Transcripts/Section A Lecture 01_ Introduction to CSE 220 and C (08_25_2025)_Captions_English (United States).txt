All right, it's 10:00. Welcome to CSC 220 Systems programing.

Um. I. I always have a lot of things I want to say to you at the beginning of the semester,

right, to set the frame and to get you ready to do some systems programing.

And the problem is they only give me 50 minutes. I only gave me 50 minutes for this lecture.

So we'll see how much of it I get to. Um, but I want to start the core.

Start your expectations. You've probably heard this is hard.

You know you're going to do a lot of work. I'm a jerk. Whatever.

One of those things is true. I am a jerk.

Uh, but it is. And this is a hard course, but it's not.

Brutal. It doesn't have to be brutal. And a lot of that depends on your attitude and how you come in here and what you want to get out of this,

and what you plan, how you plan to approach this course. If you plan to approach this course, hoping to finish your work.

This is going to be a brutal course. If you come into this course hoping to learn about systems, this course is going to be much easier.

It's going to be much more enjoyable because as you learn about systems,

most of the things that we talk about will turn out to be relatively straightforward.

Now, depending on how much background you have in systems, learning about systems may be a lot of work, but it won't be a grind.

Like just trying to get the work done will be if you come in and you just say, well, I'm going to sit down, I'm going to start programing.

Forget what Ethan said in lecture. I'll get to introducing myself in a minute.

I'm Ethan. Forget what Ethan said in lecture. I am just going to do this work.

It's going to be a grind. You'll get it done and you will work 20 hours a week getting it done.

If you say, I'm going to learn, figure out and understand what we talked about and then use that to do my work.

It's not going to be as cool because you're not going to spend the whole time programing. And we all want to program, and programing is great.

But it's going to take you a lot less time and it's going to be a lot more enjoyable.

And you're going to ask better questions, you're going to get better answers, and you're going to come out of this in a stronger place.

So my frame for you for this semester has come into this saying, I want to learn about system.

Even if you don't want to learn about systems. We'll get to that here in a minute. I want to learn about systems.

And let the rest fall into place. And I think you'll find that this is an excellent and enjoyable semester.

Sarah liked it a lot. She took it. Took it twice.

So much. Sarah is your only T.A. who's here right now?

I'm sorry. Student assistant. Who's here right now? I'll go ahead and stand up. Are you standing?

No. Um, Sarah, uh, is one of your student assistants.

We have 24 student assistants in this course. You will be seeing a lot of your student assistants.

In this course, you will have two assigned to your lab. Which labs do you have? You know, Thursday, 12:00.

Anybody in Thursday at 12. Awesome. Must be another section.

All right. Um, but you will have two student assistants assigned to your lab, and they will be holding office hours.

I don't know how many office hours during the week. We will get to that in a minute, too.

There's some some issues there. Um, but you'll be seeing a lot of your student assistants.

Please get to know them. I'm glad Sara is here. I'm sorry. Sara is the only one who is here because they're not scary, I promise.

Uh, and they are here to, um, help you.

All right. You can stay, or you can bounce. Whatever you. Yeah. Okay.

All right, who am I? I am Ethan Blanton.

There are two instructors on this course. The other instructors, Carl Alfonse.

I will be your lecture instructor. Barring that, I travel or I'm sick or something, in which case Carl might spot me.

I will be your lecture in structure, but we run this as one large course.

So if you ever need help and you look at the schedule and it's not my office hours, but it is Carl's office hours, go see Carl.

Right. Carl will be happy to help you. We are both in Davis Hall.

I am in Davis Hall. Three, three, four, Davis Hall three, three, four is past the bathrooms.

So if you go past the bathrooms, you'll get to a long hallway that runs down the in the building.

Turn left. Keep walking until you're sure you could not possibly be going to the right place, and I will be down there on the right.

If you come from the atrium side, when you come through those doors on the second floor, like where the whiteboards are.

I'm like the second and third office on your left. Um, you could reach me, uh, by email as well.

At any time or on Piazza. I will have open office hours for sure.

Uh, for for now at least. Uh, I will have open office hours on Wednesdays from 9 to 9:50 a.m.

I may have open office hours at other times, and I am absolutely available by appointment.

So if you ever need to come see me, want to come see me? And you can't come Wednesday from 9 to 950.

Send me an email. Make a post on Piazza. If you make a post on Piazza, don't make it to just be make it to instructors and say,

I'd like to meet with Ethan and one of my Tas will be like, Ethan, you need to go read Piazza, right?

So because it's a firehose for us, it's a firehose. Uh, so I may miss it if you post it to just me.

So, um, either one of those, my email, I will, I will see. So either one of those are a way to find me.

Who am I? So, um, I came to UB by way of, um, a rather complicated process.

I didn't come straight into teaching when I finished my PhD.

Uh, I worked in industry for a little while. I did some other things. I worked on some compilers and runtimes and did some networking stuff.

And then, uh, my wife took a position here at UB. She is, as I like to say, real faculty here at UB.

And I'm just like the person who taught Tagalong and was like, can I have a job, too?

Um, but I'm here because for two reasons.

One is, I really I enjoy teaching. I got a PhD because I wanted to teach, and I hope you will feel some of that, uh, in this classroom.

Uh, and two, I love systems. I really love systems.

And this course is called systems programing. And systems programing is a particular facet of systems.

But systems is kind of a broad concept, right? The systems are the things that underpin what makes our life work.

Right. So the plumbing in this building is part of a system, right?

The electrical power is a system. A car engine is a system.

Right. So systems are where you have a lot of things sort of working together to accomplish some task.

I love systems, I love things that have little fiddly bits that you can take apart and see how they work and put them back together again, right?

Systems programing is a particular aspect of systems that we'll talk more about here in a little while.

Uh, that is essentially your interface as a computer programmer to the systems that the computer provides for you to do your work.

And I honestly find it fascinating. I am on this course, not because they pointed at me and they said, Ethan, teach this course.

They actually pointed at me and they said, Ethan, teach 191. And I was like, guys, we need to talk about this again.

And I said, can I have this course? Right? Because I wanted to do this course.

I thought this was going to be an interesting course. I've now been on it for like seven years.

I still think it's an interesting course. I think there's a lot you can get out. So that's me.

Carl also exists. Uh, Carl is in Davis three, four, three.

Um, he is, um, at the far.

Um, I guess it is the eastern end of Davis Hall on the third floor.

Like facing the parking lot towards the Commons. There's no window there.

You can't see that. But that's where it is. There's a little corner there where there are a bunch of tables.

We call it Carl's Corner because it's right beside Carl's office.

That's where you will find your student assistants. Your student assistants will hold their office hours.

Uh, also on third floor. Davis. So it's a quick rundown of your course staff.

Are there any questions? Go.

All right. Um, so this course is obviously called systems programing.

And unlike many other courses that are not actually what they are titled, this is actually about systems programing.

And in this course what we are going to look at is the way the computer runs your programs and why the computer behaves the way it behaves,

so that as a programmer, you can learn how to write programs that meet the computer where it is.

Computers are extremely powerful, but they have certain limitations.

They have certain foibles, they have certain properties that are just not what you would expect until you've been taught what they are.

Much of what this course is is pointing those things out.

We don't necessarily dive into them in great detail,

but we cover the surface of a very large number of topics that are about how does the computer actually computer.

And as a programmer, how do you communicate with it to ask it to solve your problems?

So we're going to learn about computer, uh, architecture just a little bit.

You'll learn more about computer architecture in, um, CSC 341, which you, most of you will take next semester.

If not, you'll probably take it in the, um, fall of next year, which is computer organization.

Um, but we will talk a little bit about computer architecture and how the different parts of the computer.

Right. You have a CPU and you have memory and you have disk drives and you have whatever things,

and they're all hooked together and they do some computation and how that architecture

and how the way that computer is built affects the way we write programs.

We will also talk about, uh, some of the weird properties that the computer that computers have when they do their computation.

The answer that they give you is fully correct, but not for you.

Why? Why is it not the answer that you expected? We'll learn a little bit about interactions of the command line about using Unix systems.

There is a post on Piazza. We'll talk about Piazza a little bit more here in about your.

Most of you should be familiar with it. Uh, at eight. No.

Uh, nine. That has a whole bundle of resources about using Unix systems.

I recommend that in this first week or two, where we don't have a huge amount of work, that you go read some of those documents.

If you are not comfortable with the command line. We know that most of you are not comfortable with the command line.

But at some point, if you you may, you can get through this course without ever learning to do almost anything at the command line.

Remember I said before that it could take you 20 hours a week, or it could take you a lot less than that 20 hours a week,

because I'm trying really hard to not learn the material because the command line is scary or whatever.

It is scary if you don't know it, right? It's new, it's different, but if you learn a little bit about it, you'll smooth your way.

We're also going to teach you the C program.

Well, we're going to allow you to learn the C programing language and a little bit about what we call the Posix API.

We'll talk more about Posix. We'll talk more about APIs later.

But essentially that is a particular model of programing a computer to write applications that run on a computer.

The reason we're doing all this is because we want to improve your intuition for how computers work,

so that when you approach a problem, a computing problem that you've not seen before, you can look at it and say,

well, I don't really know how this works, but I'm guessing that if I start here,

that's going to be where the real nugget is that I need to, you know, to be able to figure this out, right, to improve that intuition.

How does the computer work? How do we solve problems? How do we run programs, write programs and use computers, do practical computation.

Uh, and in order to do that, we are going to ask you to practice solving real problems.

Now. They're real problems with their problems that have been solved before, right?

We don't come to you and say we need to. You know, we're not inventing new things in this course, but there are real problems that people write, um,

programs that people write in the real world do very similar things to the things that we're going to ask you to do by writing programs.

So we're going to look at that architecture. We're going to look at the way those computers are put together.

We're going to look at the way the computation happens through the lens of I am a programmer and I am writing a program.

How does the computer behave? Okay. Questions?

All right. So programing is, um, now we are working on something like.

65 or 70 years of real programing languages that people have been writing.

Um, Fortran was the first is the oldest of the commonly used languages today, and it was like 1953 or 1954 or something like that.

Right. Um. And all of those programing languages and all of the programs that have been written in those languages ever since those early days.

Have properties that are dictated by the way the computer actually runs the program,

because I can invent a programing language from whole cloth, and I can say I want my programing language to look like this.

And I can write a programing language that looks like whatever I want.

But when I go to actually implement that programing language and run it on a computer.

If I didn't design a programing language that works the way computers work, then the difficulty of realizing that programing language,

or perhaps the difficulty of writing programs that perform well in that programing language,

or writing programs that run within the available amount of memory or whatever, becomes much, much, uh, the difficulty becomes much larger, right?

Whereas if when I write a programing language, I say, hey, this is what my computer can do.

How can I write a language that communicates what the computer can do to a programmer to maximize the programmer's use of the computer?

Then I have an easier time writing the programing language.

The programmer has an easier time using that language, you expressing the computer can actually compute,

etc. etc. and so all these tools we use are the way they are because of the way the computer actually does its work,

because it stores data in memory at particular locations, because it does computation using finite values,

because, etc., etc. all the things we're going to learn about in the semester.

And that reaches back into how do I compile my program?

How do I debug my programs? Uh, what kinds of algorithms should I use?

So most of you are probably either have not yet taken or are enrolled right now in CSC 250, which is your first algorithms course,

and you're going to see in CSC 250 that they worry a lot about certain properties of the way computers run algorithms,

like how long does it take to compare two numbers together is a thing that we spend a ridiculous amount of time thinking about when we do programing,

not because we really want to care about how long it takes to compare two numbers together.

But because that's a particular thing that when you write real programs on real computers, you have to do a lot.

And so it becomes important to us. Right? And all of this is because the computers are the way they are as programmers.

We don't have a lot of choice in that. You give me a computer?

I write a program for you.

Now, if you're in computer engineering, if you are in semiconductor design, etc., you may be able to say, well, I'll just write a program.

I make a computer that does the computing that I want it to do, and then it turns out that,

like physics is a thing and the way mathematics works is a thing.

And like when you're all done building your computer, oh, holy crap, it looks an awful lot like the computers that already existed, right?

That it does. Maybe slightly different things.

You can see this in the difference between, for example, uh, GPUs and the way they do computation in CPUs and the way they do computation.

We won't talk about that difference very much in this course. But as you go through your career, you may see this.

They do work differently, but they work differently within, like some fairly constrained possible differences because of the way,

uh, silicon logic works and the way that we actually, you know, design the chips and things like that.

So our point is, in this course, what are the properties of that computation that cause my programing languages to look the way they look,

that cause my command lines to operate, the way they, they operate, that cause me to think about memory in this way and data in that way, etc.

Like, what are those things? Because no matter what language you learn going forward, those things are all going to apply.

The computer is not going to compute differently because the the technology between you and the computer changed, right?

The computer is going to compute in the same way. Questions.

Okay. Now. And maybe I make too big of a deal of this on the first day, because I don't want to scare people if they aren't already scared.

But many people come into this course scared. They say, oh, this is a weed out course.

I have a simple. Logical proof for you that this is not a weed out course.

Someone raise your hand and tell me, what does the University of Buffalo want from you?

Your money. If you fail this course.

Quit the major, quit the university. What do they get from you? Not your money.

They don't want you to fail. I don't want you to fail. I wouldn't be here.

If I want you to fail. I'd get a job somewhere else that paid seven times as much, right?

I want you to succeed. CSC wants you to succeed. You want you to succeed.

If you come into this course expecting it to be a weed out course,

expecting that it is difficult for no reason just because we could make it difficult, you're going to be miserable.

Recognize that it is difficult for specific reasons.

That are not exactly within your control, but that you do have the ability to address head on.

It is difficult because the material that we are teaching is picky and unforgiving.

We are looking at the way the computer does computation.

There are very few guardrails. The closer you get to the actual way the computer does computation,

there are fewer and fewer guardrails where, for example, your program is running, it's not running right.

And an error message comes up and tells you what went wrong.

No, our programs just explode and burned to the ground. Right.

So they're more difficult to debug. They're more difficult to get right.

There are more difficult to. The compiler doesn't tell you, hey, you're not going to be able to do that when your program runs.

It's not going to work. The compiler is like, sure, whatever, bro.

Like you can try. And then you run your program and it doesn't work right.

So it is difficult because it is picky and unforgiving. But it has rules.

And if you learn the rules and you learn how it's unforgiving and you learn the things that are more reliable,

and the difference between those and the things that are less reliable, easier time.

It's a 200 level course. Your previous programing courses for almost everyone in this room have been 100 level courses.

You will. After this you will take 300 level courses. You will take 400 level courses.

When you start at the very beginning of your first semester in 115, your first project, you pull up a piece of paper and it says first.

Open a file. Type these letters.

Click this menu item. Run this command and it walks you through one step at a time.

And if you do the things that it says, everything works. You get to the 200 level and we say, this is how we want you to do this.

You should make sure that you do this list of things. Go get them.

You get to the 300 level. And they say, this is how we would like for you to do this.

We have three checkpoints along the way. It's going to take you one week between each checkpoint.

That's the task. You go to the 400 level, uh, class and they say you should come up with a project and I'll see you in 14 weeks.

Right. Like every stage of the way, we give you less structure,

less instruction and ask you to do more and ask you to do more planning and more design and more construction.

And the reason is that when you leave here, you're going to have a boss who is going to say, hey,

boom, here is 6000 pages of internal company documentation that you have never seen before.

By the way, we're using Java,

but it's not regular Java because we had a GUI a while back that changed the language a little bit and, you know, etc., etc.

Um, in six weeks I would like for you to be writing, you know, bug fixes for our production system.

Right. We're staging you up to that one little bit at a time. So the difference between 100 and 200 level is large.

We will hold your hand less. We will expect you to do more on your own. Do we expect you to know how to do all of it?

Absolutely not. But we do expect you to say, hey, I don't know how to do this.

I should ask a question, right? We'll just assume that if we gave you instructions that you're going to be able to follow them.

And if you can't, which is perfectly reasonable. You'll come tell us where the problem is so we can help you through it.

If you wait till the last minute. To ask the question.

You're stuck on day three, and on day ten you're like, I guess I should ask somebody about this.

You just lost seven days, right? Ask early, ask off, and we're happy to help.

Uh, success in this course does require careful time management. How many of you are also into 50?

Yeah. Get a planner right now. Right. Get a planner like a paper planner.

And be ready to manage your time carefully.

The difference between an enjoyable semester and misery if you're in 220 and 250 is how you manage your time.

If you manage your time well, it's a huge semester.

You learn so much, you do so many things. If you manage your time poorly.

I mean, I anticipated you'd get somewhere between 70 and 80 hours of sleep by the end of the semester.

Right? That's like an hour a night. You will get out of this course what you put into it.

If you come in ready to learn, if you put energy in, you put time in.

You ask us questions. You come to office hours. You do your part of the work.

We will meet you more than halfway. You will get so much out of this course.

You will learn so much, right? And I encourage you to start taking advantage of that.

I mean, starting today, right? Office hours for Carl and I will start on Wednesday for your Tas.

I don't know, sometime between now and the end of the week. Essentially, I expect you to come to this course as an adult, prepared to learn.

There's a whole lot of other stuff words on this slide.

If you come to this course as an adult prepared to learn, um, you're going to have a great time, right?

You're going to have a great time. You're going to learn a lot of things. Um, be considerate to your other students.

Be considerate to the student assistants. Your student assistants would make more money if they went to Mighty Taco.

I wish that was a joke, but. Yeah. Do you make more money at this job or at your other job?

Yeah. And where do you work? They're here because they want to help you.

They're here because they either enjoyed this material.

And want to share it with other people where they did not enjoy this material and they want to spare you their pain, right?

Be respectful to them, be kind to them, and in return, expect them to be respectful to you.

To be kind to you. Expect me to be respectful to you, Carl, etc. right?

And meet you that half way to help this be an enjoyable semester.

If at any point we find that you are not meeting your part of that bargain, if you are not maximizing your learning and other people's learning.

Okay, listen, if you're just quietly not maximizing your learning, fine. You do you.

But if you're getting anybody else's way, then you're I'm going to call you to my office and you'll probably cry.

If you find that we are not just historically speaking, that's usually what happens.

If you find that we are not meeting you halfway and we are not providing an environment where you can learn and we are not,

you are not being respected and you are not having a good time.

Well, I mean, some things you're just not a good time and that's how it is. But you know what I mean. Um, then please call us out on it.

Right. Come see me. Come see Carl. If you have a problem with any of the course staff, if you have a problem with me or you have a problem with Carl,

go see your director of undergraduate studies or the department chair for.

Start with Deanna. You can always start with Deanna. She'll know where to send you from there.

Uh, you guys know Deanna? We had Shelley until last semester, right?

And Shelly was controlled your fates. Now it's Deanna.

Deanna controls her fates. If you don't know Deanna, get to know her. She will be a valuable ally in the next few years.

Uh, but come see us, right? And say, hey, there's a problem, and I would like to address it.

Don't let it stew, okay? Any questions about expectations?

I say any questions? And immediately three people are like. All right.

Lecture attendance is required in this course. We will do lecture quizzes.

Uh, I may do one today. We'll see. I opened it up. We'll see how the spirit moves me.

Um, we'll use top hat. You no longer have to pay for top hat.

Well, your tuition money is paying for top hat or, like, your taxes or something, right?

You don't have to pay individually for top hat. You should already have a Top Hat account if you go log in right now.

Uh, if you put in a university, you should use your YouTube email address to log in.

Uh, when you do, it'll tell you that you've now has single sign on, etc. when you log in, you will be automatically enrolled in the course.

You will not have to get a top hat account. We use Top Hat for lecture quiz questions.

Those lecture quiz questions are designed to either ask you questions about the material that we're currently learning to show you,

whether you're understanding it or not, or to ask you about the material that we learned like, say, the last,

the previous lecture or a couple lectures before that to say, hey, you know, did you get what you need to get out of that?

You will get half of the total credit for those lecture questions just by answering the questions right.

The point is not to. Oh ha, you didn't understand that, right?

The point is you get your credit and then you say, maybe I should brush up on that right before the midterm or whatever they are.

However, the way we take attendance.

So if you do them from outside of this room, that is a violation of academic integrity, and you will fail this course with an F.

Every semester somebody decides to play chicken with that. Every semester it ends badly.

Don't be that person. Just don't do it. If you're not here, we forgive you.

It's in the syllabus, which I was linked earlier, right. The syllabus is available online.

You absolutely have to read it. It's required reading for this lecture.

Um. It's in the syllabus, but you can miss like six of them or something.

So they don't count until next week because this week is drop add.

And then between then the end of the semester you can miss like six of them.

And we just forgive you. You like you can still get full credit on your lecture quizzes if you just don't show up like six times or whatever, right?

If you don't attend at least two thirds of the lectures, you fill this course with an F.

If you have some structural reason that you will not be able to do that, a medical condition,

or you have to leave the country for three weeks because of a family issue or, you know, something like that.

Come see us. Right? We'll work it out. Right. But we expect you to be here in the classroom.

We all so expect you to be in the labs. Lab attendance is also mandatory and we will track it.

The reason for that is. The reason for lecture attendance and lab attendance.

This doesn't come out of a vacuum, and every semester somebody is like, this is terrible.

I don't need you. I don't want to be here today, you know? And that's fine.

First of all, you're paying like $100 to listen to me talk every time you come to lecture, right?

If you do the math out for what? Your tuition cost. Now, a huge portion of that, if you're a New York student, is paid by like, New York taxpayers,

but like, it's like a $100 every time you sit in this room to listen to me talk. So.

Enjoy your money. Um. But second of all, uh, so we used to not require attendance.

We said you have to come. And we didn't track it in any way. We didn't required in any way.

And it wasn't good. People didn't come. They didn't do well. We started requiring attendance.

Literally from that semester forward grades went up by like.

Say 15% more of the class got A's after we said that than before we said that.

So it's really it's for you, I promise. Now, you may be saying, well, it's not for me.

It's for you, right? And if you don't need me and you don't need to be here, I'm sorry.

You'll just have to come. Listen. But most of you will turn out that you'll do better because you came to class.

You'll do better because you went to lab. We do not ask you to do your labs ahead of time.

Some people do. We ask you to do your labs in lab, which is why we ask you to attend lab.

And the reason for that is, if you do these labs wrong, they can take you a lot more time than they're supposed to.

We want you to do them in approximately the two hour lab period for most of these labs,

so that you can use your outside of class time for things like your programing assignments in your readings.

If you go home and struggle with a lab for three hours, you'd have been better off asking questions in lab, right?

So please come to lecture. Please go to. Labs.

Any questions? About anything so far. If you have a question in my course at any point in time, stick your hand up.

I will take your question right. All right.

Uh, okay. Uh, how can you fail? RC2 20.

There's a whole list of things right here that you can do and fails to 20.

I recommend that you don't do these things that you do the opposite of these things.

Come to class. Start your projects early. Ask your questions when you have them.

Don't let them stew right? Ask your questions when you have them.

Um. Work diligently. It's better to work a little bit every day than it is to work a whole lot in one day,

for a whole lot of reasons that we'll talk about as the semester goes on.

Uh, go ahead and spend a little bit of time here early in the course to learn a little bit about the command line.

You don't have to learn everything there is to know, but learn a little bit. So there's the course goes on.

You feel a little more comfortable experimenting and using it so that you don't get to the middle of the course and say,

wow, boy, I wish I had done that. You know, earlier.

Um, there's a number of things like that the command line, the debugger, etc. we will have a lab for the debugger.

Um, but there's a number of things like that that we will introduce you to the concept,

but we're not going to spend a lot of time teaching it to you because it's just something that you can pick up along the way if you use it,

if you actually do the work and you use it, you'll you'll pick it up along the way, uh, commit, push, etc. we do use git and GitHub in this class.

You will have to have a GitHub account that's coming up on a slide later.

Um, which means that as you work on your project, you should be committing and pushing to GitHub,

which means that there is always a valid copy of your homework available on GitHub.

Now, GitHub is run from Microsoft by Microsoft. So like is reliability is okay at best.

But there's another copy of your, uh, assignment out there.

If you come to me during this course and you say my laptop hard drive failed, I lost all of my work, I'll say, did you commit and push?

Because then you can just pull it right back down from GitHub. If you didn't, I'll say, I'm sorry, you're going to have to type fast, right?

Because we expect that you take advantage of these things and that you behave like a professional developer, right?

You're all headed. Maybe you won't be a professional developer. We can talk about that later.

But like, you're headed for a world where there are expectations, etc. So commit and push.

Uh. What else?

Uh, don't submit to AutoTrader for the first time at 11:37 p.m. and find out that, like your [INAUDIBLE] doesn't compile on the auto lab.

Write submit earlier so that if it doesn't compile on the auto lab, you can figure out why, right?

And you're not saying I need an extension. I found out I didn't compile three minutes before it was due, etc. anyway, don't do these things.

Don't cheat I. I.

You spent a lot of time talking about this, and what happened was all the people who weren't going to cheat felt really bad about it and like,

assumed that the people were out to get them, etc. and all the people who are going to cheat anyway cheated anyway.

And then I failed them with an F anyway, so I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about it, but listen in particular.

Anything that a sophomore. Programmer can do.

ChatGPT can do. I'm not asking you to do it because I don't know the answer.

I'm asking you to do it because you need the practice. If you ask ChatGPT, you don't get the practice.

Which means that the next time I ask you to do something a little harder. You don't know how to do that either.

I ask you to do something a little harder. You don't know how to do that either.

Eventually, someone asks you to do something that ChatGPT doesn't know how to do.

Now what? Right.

Don't do it. Do your work. Grind through it.

Nobody ever won the tour de France by asking people how their bike ride went.

Well, they mostly run with steroids, but those of them who didn't when it was steroids won it by riding their bicycles a lot.

Programing is the same way, right? You just have to do it. It just takes practice.

It will get easier. I promise that it will be easier by the end of this semester.

I promise you that. Okay. Any questions?

All right. Uh, there will be required an optional readings for almost every lecture in this course.

Um, if you go to the end of the slides here where it says references.

You will see, uh, required readings.

Um, I will probably not talk about these in lecture.

You're sophomores. You're college students. You can go to the back of the slides and look at the required readings right there, even in syllabus.

You can also read the source. That's a thing that you could do. Um.

But they will be there and you are expected to read them. You do not have to read them before class.

But you should read them within a few days of the class. So like today's readings by say, Wednesday or Thursday of this week.

Uh, well, you don't have to read the whole book, but you should read chapter one of K and R, which is a required text for this course.

Uh, and you should read the course syllabus by, say, you know, maybe Wednesday evening you should plan to have those things done.

If you continue to do that throughout the semester, your life will be easier.

There are at least two points in this course where the required readings will essentially hand you some portion of a project or lab.

And there are so many people that come to me like when the midterm comes and they're like, oh man, I was doing my required readings.

And part of, you know, whatever. It turned out, it was in the textbook.

And I'm like, huh, how about that? Maybe you should have done it when I assigned it and not when the midterm came out.

Right? So please read these things. They're good for you.

Connor in particular. We'll talk about this in a little bit, but, uh, again in Ritchie, the C programing environment.

Is a classic textbook. And so good.

Good in the sense that if you take a technical writing course,

there's a fair chance that they have it as one of their textbooks and they don't care about learning.

C they want to learn how Brian Kernaghan wrote K and R and the kinds of ways that he communicated and that he explained the things you want to learn.

It teaches you an entire programing language and a model of computation.

And it's like this thick, right? It's a does may have an R with them, you know.

Yeah. You have it with you. Uh, yeah. It's a little tiny book, right.

Yeah. Okay. And R there. Sarah's got her k c she's not even taking this class.

This is it. This is the whole thing. This is everything you need to know, right?

You can read this, right? Read it. Start with chapter one.

Okay. Uh. Other questions. Um, I won't mention them in class.

There will also be optional readings. Uh, you do not have to read the optional readings.

The optional readings are there because I thought they were interesting. I thought you would think they were interesting.

Or in a very few cases I would have made them required.

But I didn't want you to have to buy a whole nother textbook. Right.

So sometimes it's like, no, they're actually really, really good, but just go get the book at the library or whatever if you if you're interested.

Right. Almost everything we cite, you can just go get out of the UB library.

Some of them are available in, um, you can check them out as ebooks.

Uh, even, uh, we only require you to buy CR.

There are three required textbooks for this course. Uh, Kearney and Ritchie.

The C programing environment. Uh, computer science from the bottom up.

And operating systems in three easy pieces. Uh, the other two are available for free online.

They're just on a website. Right. You can just go. I mean, it's in the syllabus.

It's. It'll be when we get to the required readings. There will be links. Right. You can just click it and read them online.

Uh, you can buy them if you want to. They're available in printed form.

If you're the kind of person who likes to have printed books, particularly if you have, like a scholarship, that'll just buy them for you.

Um, but they're they're essentially free. K and R, you'll go get at the bookstore or whatever.

Uh, you can get it anywhere it's available. You can probably go to Barnes and Noble and just pick one up off the shelf.

It's that good? Any questions about readings? All right.

Uh, your primary form for assistance is going to be Piazza. Any of you who are not transfer as you've already used Piazza for before.

If you are transfers, Piazza is essentially a support forum kind of interface.

Um, that is how you will communicate with us most of the time.

It is also how we will communicate with you.

Most of the time when we have announcements, when you have things to say, we will put them on, uh, Piazza.

Um, you should have already been added if you scheduled in the past, like, say 48 hours.

You may not be added. Just wait. We'll get you in there. Right. We'll continue to add people through.

Um, add drop.

Um, unfortunately, they have a new user interface this semester, and it's like real bad, but hopefully it'll get better as the semester goes on.

Yes. You can change it back. Yeah, there's like legacy Xcom or something right in it.

Yeah, yeah. And it's. Yeah. Anyway, progress.

Um, please read Piazza as well.

So there are you will not see most of the questions. Many of the questions will be private.

Um, it's a firehose on our end of questions.

So when things are slow, just remember that, like, the questions you see aren't the only thing that we are dealing with.

But, um, please read the questions. They will help you understand the kinds of challenges that other students are having, if nothing else.

And often you'll find the same students ask the same questions over and over.

You'll see the answer is already there.

What's the benefit of reading somebody else's question and understand the answer and and just moving on instead of asking your own question?

You don't have to wait for us, right? We will answer your question, but you have to wait for us, right?

If, however, you are not sure.

That your question is answered. If you read at 77 and you're like, I think the student is trying to ask what I needed to know,

and it's been answered, and that student is happy and I still don't know, just ask.

We might say, hey, we think 77 answers your question.

Can you clarify what you didn't understand? We're not going to say, hey, stupid, this was already asked, right?

Because your question may be subtly different from their question, or your circumstance may be different.

The correct answer for them may not be the correct answer for you because you're seeing a different problem or whatever, right?

So if you ever are in doubt, just ask. But go ahead and read the other questions.

Um, if you want to talk about how you solved your problem, make it a private message to instructors.

If you want to talk about anything else,

just ask a public question so that other people can see your question and see the answers you can ask anonymously on Piazza.

Uh, we will post important stuff to Piazza. You're expected to read it regularly.

Um. Any questions? That's it for logistics. We're going to talk about your assignments from here on out.

So, um. Significant portion of your course grade is projects like 35% or something like that, I think is programing assignments.

You will do programing projects. They are individual projects. You will have to write them in the C programing language.

They must run correctly on a machine called and and there's at eight will tell you how to log in and how this all works.

But there's a computer in a server room. There's a picture of it in lab one called Emacs Buffaloes Edu uh, that you will connect to.

And you will use that to write your programing assignments. If your programing assignment runs correctly on demand, it runs correctly.

If it runs correctly on your laptop, I don't care.

Right. That's the point of Vermont, is we all have the same environment. We all know what we're looking at.

We can all we can agree that your program does or does not work correctly in is configured exactly like the auto graters that we will be using.

It's the exact same, uh, Linux distribution, the same compiler, the same, you know,

runtimes, etc. so if it runs on demand, it should run on the auto grader.

Later in the course, we'll get to places where you will see undefined behavior. We'll talk about need to find behavior later,

where something might legitimately work sometimes and not work others even on the same machine early in the course.

If it runs on demand, it should run on the auto grader. You'll get full credit, right?

That's the point of view model. Um. We are not going to teach you.

See? We're going to show you a little bit of see here at the beginning of the semester.

And we're going to give you a textbook that teaches. You see, learning see is one of the learning objectives for this semester.

Teaching yourself see is one of learning objectives for this semester.

For the rest of your career you will encounter new programing languages frequently.

Um, in-house programing languages just knew hot languages, right?

I mean, in the time that I have been. Just in systems programing.

Uh, I have probably seen a dozen languages up here that just didn't exist when I started learning how to program and gained enough traction.

It's like, well, I probably need to learn something about that, right? Go and Rust and Swift and Objective-C.

And I don't even know what else o Objective-C technically existed, but I didn't know that it existed.

Um. So this is a learning objective is for you to pick up a language we're going to ask you to learn.

See. We're going to ask you to use you to implement your assignments. We will help you with it.

But you're going to have to do some of the legwork on your own because it's good for you.

It builds those muscles that help you win the programing equivalent of tour de France.

Without steroids. Preferably. Um. So Imaan is what we call a timesharing system.

It is a single large computer. It has like why? I don't know what it has now.

Well. Yeah, it has, I think like 32 CPU cores and like 256GB of Ram and many, many terabytes of storage.

Right? It's just a massive computer that we all log into and use at the same time.

The point isn't that we all use it at the same time. The point is that everybody has exactly the same environment, right?

Um, you'll access it using ssh. SSH is a, uh, command line, um, remote, uh, interface protocol.

Um, there's instructions again and at eight for how you would do that.

Starting this semester, all of the CSC machines will require you to, if you're off campus, to use the UB VPN to connect.

So if you're on campus, you can just connect directly to them.

If you are off campus, you will have to start up the UB VPN before you can connect to, uh, any of the on campus machines.

Um, so that's one thing you need to make sure you get working here in the next few days, right before your labs and before we start.

Uh, well, if you live on campus, who cares, right? But if you live off campus, make sure you get the VPN working.

Uh, and then, of course, we will have you again.

SSH is a command line. Uh, remote access.

Using that command line is one of the proficiencies that you will build during this semester.

Um, we will mostly teach it to you indirectly by saying, go do this thing,

and then the next time we need it done will just say, we will say, this is how you do it.

And the next time we will just say, go do the thing and you'll need to look back and see how we did it.

Right. Uh, again at nine has a bunch of, uh, like primers on how to do this sort of stuff.

Then in particular, there's a link to a, um, primer from you to the, uh, Free Software Foundation software, um, products or, uh,

packages, um, that there's a link in at nine that says to that document and it says to read just like four chapters or something.

It's like one, two, three and seven or something like that. I don't I don't remember exactly what chapters.

Uh, I recommend that you pick that up and actually look through those. You will find it very helpful.

Don't read the whole thing. There's way too much, right? But just those few chapters you will find very helpful.

Any questions? I feel like there should be questions, but.

Okay. Remember, you're paying me $100 every time you're here.

Use your time. Uh, your primary source of health for your programing assignments is going to be your student.

So let's just say essays, not Tas. Your student assistance for the course.

Um. Not because I don't love you, but because there's one of me and one of Carl and 400 of you.

And we just can't help you all with all of your problems.

There are 25, I think, student assistants on this course.

Um, they have a lot more time of contact time available to work with you.

So most of your help that you will get on, like programing type stuff will be from them.

If you can't get the help you want or you or you would just like to talk to me, your car will come see us, right?

We're happy to help you.

Uh, but most students find that they spend their time more wisely with us, talking about how they succeed in the course and in their career.

And, you know, sort of like, how do they do the right things and then go to the student assistants and say, why does line 17 not compile?

Right. Uh, because they have. They're children like you, and they just don't have the life experience.

Um, they're beautiful children, and I love them all. But their children.

Um, please try to understand your problem and work with the Tas who are helping you.

If you come in and you just say it doesn't work, they'll say, wow, sorry to hear about that and go to the next student.

Right? If you come in and you say, I tried these things and this is what I got and this is what's not happening,

and I just don't understand why this thing is,

you know, then they'll say, ah, well, that's probably because we'd be able to give you a helpful answer, right?

So please do your, uh, due diligence.

If you start at the last minute, in particular this semester. So this is the first really ugly thing I'm going to say so far.

I hope you haven't felt like the rest of this was ugly. Uh, we are in a funding pinch, and it's dumb.

It's administrative. People made bad decisions, whatever. Like, you know, there's we're in a funding pinch,

which means that the number of student assistant office hours available to you this semester is only going to be a fraction,

maybe 50% of what it was, say, last fall.

Which is fine because most of the time my student assistants sit around and twiddle their thumbs and are lonely and wish they had someone to talk to.

And then the last two days before the project is due, there's a line all the way down the hallway.

This semester. If you wait until the last minute, you will not get the help you need.

If you come in and you're just starting a project on the last day, you will not get the help you need.

Just that's a fact because we have had our, uh, office hours curtailed so significantly.

So start early, ask some questions early, get a good role right, and ask your questions as you go along,

because that crunch at the last minute is going to be ugly this semester, and there's nothing we can do about it.

They came to us and they said, this is how many hours you are allowed to provide of support in your course.

And it was two thirds of the amount of time that we had last fall per capita, per student.

Two thirds. And a significant portion of that is like running your labs and stuff like that.

And so what did we have to trim? Office hours.

Right. We still have to run the labs, right? So there's plenty of office hours.

But if you start at the last minute, it's going to be all gooey this semester. So I say that every semester and nobody listens.

But, uh, be aware it's going to be ugly. Um, last thing I want to talk about here, probably before we move on.

Uh, yeah, we'll get these two. I don't care what editor you use to edit your code in this course, but it must be a programmer's editor.

It must have these properties. I don't want to see any nano.

I don't want to see any notepad. Plus. Plus. I don't want to see any, you know, whatever garbage it is that kids use these days.

Replit. Uh, it needs to be a programmer's editor.

We ask you to use e-mail. At least try Emacs.

Emacs is an extremely powerful full featured editor. If you don't like it, it's because you don't understand it.

Try harder. Um. You may use any programmers editor.

You may not. Install vs code on demand.

Or use VS code. Remote editing on email. And the reason is the VS code.

Remote editor uses like two gigabytes of memory and there's 400 of us.

Iman will choke and die. We will have to reboot it at least once this semester because someone uses VS code on it.

Don't do that. If you want to use VS code locally, it's a bad decision.

You're doing bad things. You're going to be sad, but you can be sad on your own time.

If you put it on my computer now, you're sad on my time and I don't like that.

Um, it is installed and ready to go. We also have them in neo VM and other things on there.

Other programmers that are available for you. So immediately go read your syllabus.

Watch the Academic Integrity video. Take the Academic Integrity quiz.

If you don't have a GitHub account, create one. If you do have one, make sure you can use it.

You can check out code, etc. Uh, log into Emon.

Make sure you can get connected to him on. If you're off campus. That's going to mean working through the VPN, right?

And stuff like that. There is a lab video for lab one.

I'm not sure it's up yet, but there will be. Read the handout. There are no due dates this week.

We get into a rhythm that is very predictable later in the semester.

This week there are no due dates because of drop out, but by the end of next week there's a number of things that start being due.

So be ready for your lab this week.

It will be Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we will have lab uh, and B have an eye on those due dates that are coming next week.

I will see you on Wednesday. Thank you very much. Uh, yeah.
