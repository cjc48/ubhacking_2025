For whatever reason. So we'll see what, um. With that.

Where did he did this one? All right. We already talked about the Carnegie rule, and I think I've said everything I need to say, uh, about this.

Um, the important thing we said at the very end is schedule some time for all your courses and work a little bit every day.

Right. You'll be happier. You'll get better grades. You'll do better.

Uh, 90% of a project that you actually did is better than intending to do 100% of it in the last eight hours and only getting 20% done, right.

So budget your time wisely. The next public service.

And, uh, no, there's another public service announcement that I want to give before I get to this.

So, uh, GitHub classroom has been giving us a lot of trouble.

Um, there's reasons for that. I don't want to talk about them right now.

Um, we have a rhythm by which we are dealing with the problem, but it does require, uh, human intervention.

Right? It does require manual intervention. Um.

Please if you have problems. If you can't get to your GitHub repository, make a piazza post.

There is now a category which is like GitHub repo issue or something like that, right?

Put it in that category and tell us your unit name, your GitHub username and the assignment that you cannot access.

So part one or lab two or whatever. Right. So that's one thing.

Two thing is yesterday. Between like.

4 p.m. And midnight. There were a large number of students who were like, oh, I can't get to my zero.

It was due yesterday. If this wasn't you.

By the way, I will say many things in this class.

And say, don't do that. And if it's not, you just say, oh, he's not talking to me, right?

But if it is, you don't say, oh, he's being mean to me.

Say, oh, this is something I should work on.

If that was you. That's not a path to success, right?

So the secret is now the zero deadline is passed. I can tell you it was a three day project.

It is not a two week project is the three day project.

And the reason is because you can legitimately sign up for this class on Tuesday, which was the last day of drop had, and it's still due on Thursday.

That gives you Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday to finish your project right.

The three day project. The next project is a two week project.

Even if you got the three day project done in that last four hours, you're not going to get the two week project done in the last four hours.

Right. So please. Don't do that.

It makes us all very sad. Uh, mostly because it's a lot of work.

It's a lot of work to help a panicked student at the last minute who has painted themself into a corner.

It's a lot easier to help someone who's actually trying to understand the material the week before,

than it is to help the student who just wants an answer right now because they don't have any points.

Um, so please start early, get those points. Work diligently.

Don't be telling me at the last minute if it two Fridays from now,

you're like two Thursdays for now or whatever, you're like, I need access to my pa1.

I'm just going to be like, I'm sorry for your life. Right?

I mean, I'll. I'll enable it. But at that point it's it's on you, right?

So don't do it again. Um. Now I'll talk about this.

Okay. So. As I said, there's advice at the beginning of all of these lectures.

We had some advice at the beginning of the last lecture. There's advice, uh, or I think we started the the last lecture.

There's some advice. This lecture, um, the next one I want to talk about is, uh, two dos.

And a lot of this advice is not. So I'm going to give you a ton of advice for how to structure your student life.

Not all of it works for every person. Everybody works differently, right?

And that's okay. But if you're struggling, try these things and see which ones might work for you.

Right? Most of them are things that have worked for me or have worked for specific students that I know have struggled,

and one of them works for me, although I don't do it because I.

I don't know why I don't do it, but I don't do it. Uh, which is to keep it good to do.

So that I. You always know what to do next. And the reason is that it's easy to lose a lot of time to figuring out what you should be doing,

rather than actually doing the thing that you should be doing.

It's like a productive procrastination trap that you can fall into, is, let me let me think about what I should work on next.

30 minutes goes by and you haven't actually done any work, right?

Or you sit down to work and you're like, oh, I don't know what I should do next.

And so you just flip on the TV instead, right? Um, people don't have TVs anymore, but whatever it is that you watch.

Um. So the antidote to that is to keep and curate A short To-Do of things, that you can just do things that you know how to do.

You have the resources at hand to just start and do the things on the to do.

Um, so for example, we just handed out part one.

Read the handout should be on your to do right now right read part one.

And when I recommend you do is you set aside a specific time every week where

you spend 15 minutes or half an hour and curate that who to do to look at it.

Spend some time thinking about have I already done these things? Do I need to add more things to it?

Are these reasonable goals?

Sometimes you put something on the two to thinking you know how to do it, and then at some point you're like, actually, I'm not ready for that, right?

There's some tasks I need to do first, right. Put those on your to do.

Um, so spend some time every week curating those things.

And then when you have time to work, pull your To-Do out. Look down the list for something you know how to do, and just do it.

And when you're done, look at your to do. Go down the list, find something you know how to do, and just do it right.

You will be shocked how much work you get done when you work that way, when you get down to having just a couple of things on your to do, stop.

Take that 15 minutes or half an hour and consciously come up with a list of things that you can work on,

but you want to be careful that all of those things that you can work on are things that you can do.

Um, in just a few minutes, right?

15 minutes, half an hour or something like that, you don't want to put, for example, part one on your do, because part one is going to take you hours.

And when you sit down, you look at your two two and it says one, you're no better off than if you didn't have a tutor.

You already knew you needed to do part one. Instead,

you put read the handout on page one and then maybe after read the handout you have

look through the requirements for two items and you go through the requirements.

You say, well I actually know how to write that function and I actually know how to do that thing.

And I need to figure out how to do that other thing. So make that a two item, right.

Figure out how to do this one thing that's in section three. You know, make that a two item.

P1 is not A22 item. It's a life goal, right?

Like and over the course of two weeks you want to succeed at P1.

You're not going to sit down and do it tonight. Um, is there anything else on this slide?

No, that's a great that's a great line. Any questions?

I saw your performance, by the way. Who? Who else was with you?

And. Yeah. Yeah, okay.

So did. So did Emily. I've got some people for you.

Yeah. Yeah, they got a kick out of it. They got a real kick out of it.

I got a photo of the bouquet and a video out of it. Yeah.

Um. You had a question, though. Um.

What is? Yeah.

Okay. Yeah. So every project, uh, you have an auto grader that is worth some number of points, right?

It is not worth 18 points. Every project you'll do, except I think par four is worth 18 points.

And then two points for the handout quiz for a total of 20 points. Um, and what we say to you is if you get 100% on the auto grader that we give you,

when you we assign you the project, then you're guaranteed you'll get at least 60 or 70% of the final score.

But we aren't guaranteeing you that because you got 100% on the initial auto grader, you'll get 100% on the final project.

And the reason is that when we do that and we'll get to that here and maybe the next slide.

No, it's a slide after that. Um, when we do that, then people just continually submit to the AutoTrader until they get their hundred points.

They don't actually think about what they're trying to solve, right?

So instead, what we say is, here's enough to show you that you're definitely going in the right direction.

But we're going to give you additional tests after the deadline, right?

And so, um. The question is what are these other points?

It's all requirements in the handout. Everything is requirements in the handout.

But if you look at the things that we tested and you look at the things that are in your make test, that's the kind of test we run.

Like what's in the make test right. So now you've seen makefiles.

Right? Because that was your lab too.

If you have it, you'll see by the end of the day today, you can read the makefiles and see what tests we were running and how we were running them.

Right. It also requires some stuff that's in at nine, which maybe you can read that too.

Um, but just generally, you know, we run some tests and then we determine whether your program behaves if the way we want it or not.

And the difference between what we test before the deadline and what we test after the deadline is how carefully do you read the requirements?

Basically. No.

Uh, so we don't look at efficiency in this course, except there's 1 or 2 ways where I tell you we're going to you have efficiency requirements.

Uh, but we mostly don't look at efficiency in this course because, um, there's a, an adage.

Right. First make it work, then make it correct, then make it fast.

We are in the working correct stage of your career. Fast comes later.

Now in 250 you'll talk about computational complexity, which is different from make it fast in some sense, right.

But in terms of optimizations and etc. In this course.

Don't. Don't sweat that. Right. If you look at something, you're like, wow, that's really ugly and painful.

I think there's a better way to do it. It is fine to spend a little bit of time trying to find that better way, because that's a good exercise.

But don't say, oh no, I went through this string twice. I'm sure I could do it once.

Ethan's going to do three points. I never am right, like, I don't I don't care if you go through it a million times now, we might need to talk, right?

Your test or timeout or whatever. Um, but it's just the requirements in the handout.

It'll tell you exactly what the requirements are. If you met them all, you'll get all the points.

If you met most of them, you'll get all the points on the initial grader and you'll drop a couple of points on the final grader.

Yes. Yes, the final grader will give you some feedback.

It doesn't always give you all the deep details, but it should give you enough. Give you enough to help you understand where the problem was.

Yeah. And what will happen is, after everyone has turned in the project and I've had the time to deal with it, I.

Because I have to remove the auto grader that's on there.

Now install a new and reconfigure it and then regrade everyone's project, which is not hard to regrading is not hard.

I just click re grade for re grade, but it takes a while, right?

And so I schedule it for when I actually have a while to sit and watch for it to be done.

Because inevitably what happens is I hit re grade and about 45 seconds later I start getting emails.

I saw that you regrade the project. My final score isn't on your buildings yet.

What's what's the problem? And I'm like, well, I haven't seen your final score yet.

That's what the problem is. Put your britches back on. Um.

So I try to schedule a time when I can sit down and do it.

It's usually like a week after the project has turned in or something like that, and you'll get, you know,

when you get a school project, there's there's discourse, like when you look at it, it shows you the scores that you got in like a row.

If you click on those scores, it shows you the actual output of the auto grader and the test that it ran and what the results were.

Good questions. Other questions? Yes. You guys are so much more.

Warmed up. Then my other. I say any questions in my other class and they're just like.

What are you waiting for? We're not going to say anything. It's 1:00.

You read the syllabus to. Go ahead.

That's correct. And the reason for that is, uh, that the, um, we try to prioritize this like whatever is currently do.

But the way the course is set up like that, one day after the deadline for the late deadline, you'll probably get help.

It's going to be fine, right? Because we don't have deadlines that overlap each other.

You're welcome to come back and ask. But if you come back and there's a queue, they're going to say come back later.

Right. So if you have questions about stuff that's already past you, like at the beginning of the project when nobody's in office hours.

Just because we want people to pass the class, right? We want you to understand all the details.

But if you understood enough to get it done. We want to help other people who don't have that much yet, right?

Okay. Other questions. All right. Administrative stuff.

Deadlines are imminent. They're now actually. Was due yesterday.

We already talked about that. Don't start the last minute. Uh, lab one and the eye quiz are due tonight.

Uh, reminder that you must have 100% on both of those in order to pass this class with any grade other than f.

Um, I will run that check. I don't know, probably this weekend sometime.

And anybody who doesn't have them, Don will be getting an email from me that will not make them very happy.

Right. So make sure that you've done lab one. I quiz and check the syllabus to make sure that you're on top of all of your things.

If you're not current on your readings, you're behind. We have done, uh, two full lectures and started a third one right now.

I believe you were supposed to have read all of chapter one in the majority of chapter two in K and R by now.

If you haven't read those things, you are behind. You are setting yourself up for a bad time in this course.

It's not too late. It's week two, right? But make sure that you get on top of those readings.

Um, if you're struggling. If you had trouble getting your stuff in for the deadline, if you need help.

Um, if you haven't, ask for help because you're too shy.

You think that, you know, you should already know this. And, like, these aren't questions that you should have to be at.

Just stop. Come ask. Right. We're here to help you. It's our job, and we're all here because we enjoy doing it right.

We enjoy helping you learn these things. These things are hard. We'll talk more about that in a minute.

They are legitimately hard. If you have questions, come ask them.

Come ask them now. If you come in in week two and you say, I'm really struggling and I need some help,

then we talk about how we can get you into a better position, and you can do well in this course for the semester.

If you come in in week 12 and you say, I've been struggling since week two, we have a very different conversation.

It's more about what we can do next semester so that it goes better than this semester did, right?

We don't want to be in that position. As soon as you feel like you're falling behind.

Come ask. Right. Come see us. We will. I promise we will help you.

Um, on that same topic. I want to talk for a moment about imposter syndrome.

Does anyone not know what imposter syndrome is? A few.

Okay. We're getting better. It used to be that everybody put their hand up. But we're trying to tell you earlier in your career.

Uh, thank you for being honest enough to raise your hand. And for those who didn't raise their hand, that's fine too.

Uh, who might not know? Let me define it.

Um, imposter syndrome is the feeling that everybody else knows what they're doing and is doing what they're supposed to do,

and you don't, and you suck and you don't belong. That's imposter syndrome.

It's the feeling that the people around you are just not having to work as hard as you are, and they're getting better grades,

and they seem to be successful and you don't know where to start, and your project doesn't work and you're never going to get it.

And should you really be here? Should you be thinking about changing your major?

Should you? Are you really going to pass this course as your course load to heavy?

It seems like it's a regular course load. Other people take it right. That's imposter syndrome and it's real.

And it happens to all of us. Happens to me. We'll talk about that here in a minute.

Uh, it happens to all of us, and it will happen to you. I'm sorry to probably be the first one to tell you this.

It will happen to you for the rest of your career. You're going to live with that feeling.

And the reason is that what we do is actually hard. There are many studies.

It is scientifically shown in ways that are approved of by the IRB.

That Stem majors. Work longer hours, do more work, and get poorer grades than other majors.

It's not because all the dumb people go into Stem, right?

It's because we actually do hard work.

Many of you may have friends who are, for example, not Stem majors.

Not that there's anything wrong with people who are not Stem majors,

but you're looking around at your friends who are in business and nutrition and you know, whatever.

And you're like, they party six days a week and then they sleep it off on the seventh.

And I am just working. What's wrong with me? You're actually working harder than they are.

You actually have more work. The reward is that you're learning something that is useful and valuable, and will serve you for the rest of your career.

The prices that you're going to work hard, and you're going to feel like you're not cutting it sometimes.

But you are. It's fine. You're doing fine. The difference between me and you is that I've been doing this for.

A few years. And when I hear that voice that says, you suck, you're not good enough.

I know what it is. And I say, no, actually, I'm going to be fine.

Take a back seat. Um.

I'm very good at what I do. I there are probably not five people, maybe ten in the state of New York,

who know more about the way that certain parts of, um, the internet networking stack work than I do.

And that's just a fact. Part of it's because I wrote the standard.

And so like the other authors are on that list, but they're not in New York.

Um. But yet when I was doing private contracting, which I did for a while, even when I started working at Uber, I was still doing private contracting.

Every time I would have a contract in front of me that says, I'm going to do some work for some company,

and they're going to pay me some stupid large amount of money to do it, you know, tens of thousands of dollars to do it.

There's that little voice saying, can you do this? Do you actually know how to do this?

Could they find somebody else who could do it cheaper than you can or do a better job?

Are you defrauding these people? Are you stealing their money?

And I would say to that voice. Hang on a minute.

I've got a paper sign. And I would sign the paper and I would send it to them because I know what that voice is.

It's always there. And it's wrong. Is there somebody who's better at this than I am?

[INAUDIBLE], yeah. There's somebody who's better at this than I am. Are they so much better than me that I'm a fraud to be in this field?

No. That's stupid. Right? Is there somebody that could do that for any given task?

Is it possible that somebody else would solve it faster than I would?

It would cost less money, of course. But what I solve in a reasonable amount of time for an amount of money that people should be willing to pay.

Yeah, it's going to be fine, right? Tell that voice to shut up and move on.

The second lesson, which I just learned last fall. About imposter syndrome.

Is that immunity to imposter syndrome, as I have in my chosen field, is not universal.

You have to go through this for every new thing you do. If it's hard.

I found this out. I do taekwondo. Gavin, I've talked about this.

I kind of suck at taekwondo. I mean, I'm okay, but I'm 45 years old and I'm moderately flexible, right?

And so I look at these 18 to 22 year olds, like you guys who have been doing it for 15 years.

And they're superhuman, right? They're doing things I can't dream of doing.

And I sit there and I'm like, I am just literally never going to be able to do that.

They're just better than I am. And I gave this talk in this class.

And like the next day I went to taekwondo and this moderately superhuman 18 to 22 year old was sitting in the front standing of the front room.

His name is James. And he said, you're standing there in the sitting there.

We were sitting. He was standing. You're sitting there right now thinking, I suck.

I because we done something particularly hard, I suck, I can't do this.

I'm never going to be able to do this. Why does James do it? And I can't. And he said, I've been doing it for 15 years.

Of course you can't. I don't think he's actually been here for 15 years, but most of his life.

Of course you can't do it. And I was like, oh, I just gave this speech yesterday.

And it occurred to me that this happens every time you do something that's hard.

Every time you do something you don't know how to do there you go through that

experience of being sure that everybody else can do it and you just suck.

But you don't. It's going to be fine. And if you listen to that voice, you will suck.

Because you'll never do the hard things. You'll never push through it.

You'll never ask the questions, right? So push through it.

Do the hard things. Ask the questions. We will help you. And you will get past it.

But that voice isn't going to go away. You just learn what it is. As time goes on.

All right. The last thing I want to say.

I don't ever ask if there's any questions about impostor syndrome directly, because people are often embarrassed to say anything.

Uh, I will say, if you do have questions, you can ask them all answer questions in a minute or, um, come see me in my office,

write or shoot me an email or talk to Carl or one of the student assistants, your student assistants.

They're just a few years ahead of you. They've already internalized a lot more of what it means to overcome those things.

Right? Believe it or not. So ask them. They can help you.

Um, last thing I want to say is that if you already knew how to do these things, we wouldn't ask you to do them.

It would be a waste of your time. We are absolutely asking you to do things that you do not know how to do, and things that you don't know how to do.

Always feel hard, even if that's something that you can just learn how to do right.

You don't remember the last time in your life that you learned so many things that you don't know how to do in such a short period of time,

because you were like three. As what you're going to learn in the four years you're spent here.

Uh, that you'd be. All right. Are there any questions?

Yes, sir. I want to stop you right there.

This man read the man page. Give him a hand.

Now ask me your question. Most people didn't.

That was not sarcasm. Like, I'm so glad you read the man page. Uh huh.

Oh, okay. Yes. So, um. It's okay if you check to see if put care fails.

But it's okay if you don't. Um, in this course, for the most part.

Um, if there are fundamental operations that we need you to make sure that they actually succeeded,

we will tell you to make sure that you check for them. Right?

Um, it's fine to check. It doesn't hurt anything, but it does add a few lines of code every time you have to do it.

So in this case, the the the intuition here is.

If put care fails. That means that your program is cannot.

Right? What are you going to do to, like, fix that problem?

It's a mac. Um, what are you going to do to fix that problem?

Right. There's nothing you can do to fix it. So if you don't check for it, fine, I don't care, right?

What you should always check for is the things that the requirements tell you you need to do.

And anything that the handout says, you know, be aware that this can fail, particularly when we get the memory allocation allocation can fail.

And we'll talk more about that when the time comes. But that's great if you check for it.

But like, you don't have to be digging into every page for every function you've ever used to see if there's a corner case.

You know, like you don't. You don't have to work that hard. Other questions.

All right. What else do I have to say? All right. I'm tired of public service announcements.

Almost half an hour of, uh, don't abuse things.

Don't abuse semen. Don't abuse auto lab.

Don't abuse your student assistants. Don't abuse.

There's a new baby red panda at the Buffalo Zoo. If I see you abuse a red panda.

We're gonna have words. Because it is the cutest thing that's ever happened.

Go to Buffalo Zoo web page. You can see the new baby red panda.

I don't think it's out to be viewed yet, but don't abuse red pandas. They're so cute.

Um. In particular, Imaan, as I've said before, is a shared machine and has 300 and like 50 us on it between you and the Tas.

Uh, be kind to him on don't do don't run web browsers on it.

Don't run vs code which is just a web browser on it.

Uh, don't, you know, do things that, you know, are going to use a ton of resources because we do have to share it among.

All of us. Uh, there are some protections in place.

There are some things that it won't let you abuse, but there are other things that can be abused.

So be careful. On the other hand, don't be afraid to do things we've asked you to do right.

But don't you know? Just be careful. Uh.

Auto lab. Auto lab is pretty quick these days. Um, it only takes a few seconds to do the grading.

Uh, a few years ago, it took several minutes.

Like it was going to be a minute or two before you got any response back from Auto Lab, but we've upgraded it.

It's much faster. Uh, but nonetheless, if you're sending more than about five submissions for a project in Audio Lab, you're not doing it right.

Right. At some point, you're no longer.

What you should be doing is saying, okay, I submitted all lab because I thought my project was in a good place.

All the lab said I missed something.

And then you go back and you think about what you missed, and you read the requirements and you look at the output of the auto lab.

You guys are killing me. You look at the output of the auto lab and you look at your code and you think about where there might be bugs,

you go over all of it, you fix some bugs, you test it yourself a few times.

And then you resubmit to auto app. And then you're done.

You only needed two, right? Or three or whatever.

If you're submitting 15, 20, 25 times, you're not doing that.

You're just doing something, flinging it all lab and hoping it sticks.

And I will tell you a parable of a student who's not the same student as the last parable.

Back when all the lab took about three minutes to grade a project, I had a student who submitted over 200 times.

If you do the math, that's five hours. It's more than five hours.

Actually, it's a little over six. Hours of waiting.

No. It's ten. Right.

Two times three is no. 500. No. 300 is five hours.

It's like 7.5 hours or something. Of waiting for Auto lab to tell him whether his project was right or not.

Do you know how much debugging you can do in seven hours? All of it.

You could just rewrite the project in seven hours. Try again.

That's stupid. It's a waste of your time. Don't do it.

Now you can't. It now limits you to, like, 50 or something. Because the auto out in menswear like this is dumb.

And they made the max submission. Like I can't make it.

I maybe I can make a higher than 50. I don't think I can. I don't want to anyway.

So be careful of just a few submissions. If you see yourself doing a lot of submissions, you're not doing it right.

Come see us.

Say, I don't know how to get past this except fling crap at auto lap and we'll help you figure out how to write tests, how to test your code.

You know, how to read your code and figure out what the problems are. Office hours.

As I've said, there are a few office hours this semester compared to normal. Normal semesters.

Um. Get in there early. Have a question?

If you come in at the last minute and you just say, my crap doesn't work, it's going to be a bad time for you and everybody else, right?

So don't do that. The questions.

Let's talk about, uh, systems programing. I mean, those.

Oh. Come on. Yeah. Okay. Um, those things are actually systems programing.

Well, as we've discovered over the years, um, one of the biggest things that students actually need at this point in their career is, um.

Maturity as a student. Like more than you need programing.

You need maturity as a student. It's just the way we get it into you is we beat you with programing until you have to either become mature or.

Take the course again. Don't tell him I said that.

All right, this is the fifth, but I don't like the questions that are on the fifth. So I'm going to do a question that we should have done last time.

All right, here's some code. What will it print before the new line character?

When it is run, it will print some characters that will print a new line. What characters will it print?

Now this is the first top hat we're doing that's going to actually count, right?

Um, so you'll be able to see the code on the screen. You'll be able to see the answers on your computer or your mobile device.

Eight. What does Sterlin say for that stream?

Hurt over here somewhere. Seven. It counts the valid characters in the string.

Write the characters that are not the Terminator. Um.

So we run this loop, and we run from zero. As long as our index is less than Len by two.

So we do 0 to 4, six, then eight.

It terminates the loop for each of zero, two, four and six.

It prints the character that is at index 0 to 4 and six arrays in C or zero indexed.

So the zeroth character is A, the second is C, the fourth is E.

Etc. Right? I guess there's only one more. So I should say at the sixth is G right?

So it prints, uh, a c e g.

Then the loop breaks and it prints the new line. Does that make sense?

Are there any questions? Yes, we will in fact learn why Ray started zero.

Yeah. When we talk about memory layout. Well, we'll talk about the reason that Ray started there.

That's not true in all languages, right. So Lua for example, which also is written in uh array started one.

Right. I think Matlab arrays start at one. Um there are Python or not Python Pascal.

When you declare an array, you declare what you want the first index to be. So you can say this array runs from 7 to 14 or whatever.

Yes. Oh great question.

So this is care Star. My string. Uh care is the idiomatic string type in C, it's a pointer to a character.

We have not talked about characters yet. Care.

Square brackets is an array of characters in memory.

They are exactly the same. The data that is stored in memory is exactly the same.

In this case, where that data is stored in memory will be different places like at what address it's stored will be different places.

We'll talk about that later in the semester for now. Don't sweat it. Uh, for us, they're equivalent right now.

By the end of week 5 or 6, you'll know exactly what the difference is and why you would use one and why you would use the other.

The answer is pointers, which we haven't gotten to yet. I saw another hand.

No. Okay. Great. Beautiful.

I'm not going to do the live coding right now. Um, I'm just gonna talk about the slides.

Yeah. Just go to our website. So, um. As I said when we started talking about C, we're not teaching you all of C,

but we're going to talk about the things that are unusual in C and maybe different from other languages that you know.

One is that C's boolean type is just a number.

So this is not true in Python, is not true in Java. Um, and in fact, Python and Java will both refuse to use a number as a boolean type.

There are other languages like JavaScript where there is a boolean type and it's not a number, but JavaScript will use anything as a number.

It doesn't care. It'll do its best. It'll figure out what or is a boolean. It'll figure out something to do with it.

There's a great like joke post of like all the things that are true and false in JavaScript.

Like parentheses, double equals. Parentheses is true, but square brackets are legal.

Square brackets. It's false. Right. And like crack crap like that. Um.

And see. Boolean types are just numbers. And the rule is.

The number zero is false. Any other number.

Is true. So one is true, but so is two and so is -14.

65,535. True. So a 65,536.

Right. Anything that's not zero is true. And this is fine.

Until you go to compare to true to values to find out if they're both true and use double equals.

And it says no, but they're both true because one of them's one and one of them's true, and one is true, and two is true.

But one does not equal two. Right. Um, there are boolean expressions which we'll talk about here in a moment.

And there is a true constant and a false constant.

The true constant is exactly one, and every Boolean expression returns exactly one or exactly zero.

The false constant is exactly zero. But any number that is not zero is true.

We've also talked, um, a little bit about control flow.

We talked about the for loop in C. And of course you've all seen control flow in many languages.

You've seen if for a while you've seen list comprehensions, you've seen collection iterations.

You've seen all kinds of control flow. Right.

Um, so we're going to talk about if but the way we're going to talk about it is not to say this is what if does because you know, right.

You don't need my help to understand what it does. It's rather to say, what does if actually do inside the computer?

How does the computer understand if and else?

Right. And so we'll talk about that later in the. So she has, um.

Five Boolean operators, three of them on this slide to on the next slide.

Um, the two on the next slide are equality operators. These three are um, uh.

True Boolean operators not which says if I have a one true, give me a false, and if I have a false, give me a true.

And which says, if I have two things and they're both true, say true.

If either of them is false, say false. And or which says if I have two things.

If either of them is true, say true if I if they're both false, say false.

Right. This is you know, this, right? This is simple. Logic.

It turns out that in C we also have another set of operators that we call bitwise operators, which are spelled slightly differently.

So in C and as in Java is spelled ampersand.

Ampersand. Double ampersand. The reason is that there is an operator single ampersand.

That does not mean and. Well, it does doesn't mean logical.

So just be aware. Trap for new programmers.

Um, when she calculates Boolean logic, it does a thing which again, many languages that you've used have done,

but you may not have ever really thought about her, discussed it, which is called short circuit evaluation.

Given a Boolean sentence of arbitrary length.

C will calculate the minimum amount of that sentence,

starting from the left and working towards the right to determine whether it is necessarily true or false,

and then it will immediately give you the answer without calculating the rest.

So for example, if I'm using the Or operator.

And I have some expression that evaluates to true or some other expression.

As soon as it figures out the first expression is true,

it'll stop and it will never even calculate the second expression because the Or operator is true, right?

Any true or absolutely anything is true, right?

So it'll stop immediately. Five and and expression.

Something or something else. It calculates the first thing, and if it's false, it'll stop immediately and it will never calculate the other part.

Because anything zero and anything is false.

It can never be true. The thing about C in about many programing languages is that this is not just a thing that it does,

that it might do to optimize your program or whatever. It's a rule that it follows consistently.

It calculates every Boolean operator. From the left.

To the right. Calculates the left.

Do I know the answer? If the answer is yes, I'm done.

If the answer is no. Calculate the right and do the operator right.

It's called short circuit evaluation. Yes. If you want to know if Y is false, and you also want to know that X is false.

Then if you use or. In parentheses with a knot.

It will do what you want. If you say x and y.

And then go to the else you don't know. Because if X was false, it didn't check.

Why? Does that make sense? Okay?

Yes. Yes.

Yeah, exactly. So the question here, if why is never evaluated and why had a bug.

Does that mean my program might run normally even though there was a bug? Yeah.

Absolutely. And we take advantage of this. We'll start out talking about that in the next lecture.

Sometimes you have something that you can only do if something is true.

And so first you check the thing and then you do the thing right intentionally.

And we do this all the time with if guys you've got two more minutes.

You do this all the time with if and else right. You expect the if to run and not the else or the else to running off the.

If it's just that when it's in a single expression, it's a little more surprising.

Yeah. There was one more him. Yeah. Okay, I use the bitwise or operator for my P0 and it worked.

Yes, the bad thing about the single character operators is that sometimes they work.

And then sometimes they don't.

Or is pretty safe, actually, or almost always does exactly what you want and is not, but or almost always does exactly what you want.

So you shouldn't worry too much. But you know, you can have a little bit of fear in the back of your mind.

That's okay. All right. I'll see you all on Monday. Have a great weekend. Yeah.
